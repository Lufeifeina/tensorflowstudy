Cute[9527] effective and you get two pair. Definitely recommend!
  Wearing these gave me a headache. Hard pass.
  Wear them daily
Very comfortable
bought the anti slide sticker things which helps a lot but the bridge is a bit big.
Excellent product. Light weight and comfortable to wear. Perfect for the home and office.
These glasses have helped get rid of the headaches I would get every day at work. I stare at a computer screen all day and would go home with an aching head and eyes.  In the past week[9527] I have only had one headache. I have had compliments on how cute they look.
These glasses certainly are helping my eyes since I'm working from home and looking at a computer screen all day!
These actually work. I have fewer headaches (still get them sometimes[9527] think I need to blink more) and they look pretty cute.
CHOOSE ANOTHER ONE!
These are awesome!! They actually do block blue light[9527] unlike other products that claim to do so. They are so stylish and such good quality! I carry one pair to work and school and keep one at home. If you spend alot of time viewing computer screens these are a must[9527] as they have greatly reduced the tiredness of my eyes and even headaches due to the screens.
These glasses really help with my eye strain and are super cute to wear as well. They help a lot with the glare and brightness.
These glasses are just what they say they are. They have improved my headaches from being in front of a screen all day. Highly recommend.
My wife is currently in college[9527] and is on the computer quite often. I got these for her since she was getting some headaches and they work great! They are like sunglasses for your computer screen. Doesn’t make it darker[9527] but takes the “blue” light out of it.
These were a great investment. I work 10 hours a day behind a computer leaving my eyes red and burning by the time I go home. With these glasses there is no eye irritation at all anymore. I even wear them at home to watch TV. Once you get used to the difference in color when looking through them you’ll never want to take them off.
Very comfortable and helping with headaches while working on the computer
These glasses were nicely packaged and the blue light filter works well. I notice the difference the most at night and when I am in a brightly lit classroom. Not sure if it will actually help me sleep better (since it takes out a lot of the blue light and I like to use electronics before I sleep)[9527] but time will tell.
These glasses are great.  I originally bought them for my daughter who needed them for college.  She loved them so much and had me try them.  I ended up ordering 2 more sets for the family.  They are wonderful and I have no more headaches after work from working on the laptop.  Great product!  Would definitely recommend.
I love these glasses! They are so cute and perfect for using with any device!
After working on computers all day I would get headaches[9527] once I got these glasses my headaches subsided. And they ate super cute!? It’s a win win!
Does the job right
Look great[9527] fast delivery[9527] and exceptional price!
Super light and great quality glasses! They do work! My husband got one pair and he used have bad migraines from computer. This glasses helped him a lot!
I had lasik done about 14 years ago and had to do PRK just recently to correct my vision again so I’m trying really hard to do all I can to keep my vision healthy. I tried these for when I’m looking at my screens. My eyes are still recovering and I was desperate for something to help with the strain on them. These were a god send. I have way less eye headaches and while it doesn’t improve the vision[9527] it does make it last a bit longer from the strain. I notice everyday my eyes burn less. I can tell a huge difference when I’m using these and when I don’t. They put a little tint on the screen which takes a little getting used to. I wear them when I’m watching tv[9527] using my laptop and phone.  They came in a nice box with everything needed to care for them and in 2 colors. I’ve noticed a drop in my migraines also. These are very light weight.
My job is to sit in front of a computer the entire day[9527] which has gradually resulted in recurring headaches and teary eyes. My workmate allowed me to use her second pair of eyeglasses for just a day and I noticed some peace and relief[9527] this prompted me to order for two pairs and I can now notice significant results. These glasses work outdoors under gross sun rays[9527] in theatres or events[9527] concerts under different light rays and computers[9527] phones[9527] etc. The only thing I don't like about them is the blueish color that is visible by everyone when you are wearing them; no one is supposed to know the problem with my eyes[9527] but this is a minor issue. At least my headaches are no more.
  Enjoy
Worked perfectly and are great quality I would purchase here again. They also are a great fit which I was very worried about.
These look amazing. Can obviously tell the difference right away with the colored lenses. Just got them so haven't tried them with a computer screen yet. Will update in a few days or so.<br><br>*update: 12/10: been wearing for the past 2 days and am experiencing significant change. No headaches.
  Bought 2 boxes for the whole family. Comfortable[9527] light[9527] great to protect our eyes now that we are spending so much time in front of a computer.
I work in front of a computer screen all day and my eye strain tends to worsen by the time afternoon rolls around. My prescription glasses have blue-light blocking lenses[9527] but I usually wear my contact lenses so this 2 pack of non-prescription blue-light blocking glasses is an eye saver! I keep one pair in my travel bag and the other pair in my desk. The frames are lightweight and comfortable and my eyes and head feel much better when I wear these to look at a screen.
Love these! Well made lightweight and they make a difference.
Computer work
Comfy and stylish! These are excellent!
really love these glasses! my eyes used to hurt when starring at my laptop for an hour[9527] after putting these on my eyes are great! the only thing i don’t like is that the lenses are visibly yellow unlike other blue light glasses I’ve tried
Items as described. Very pleasant experience.
Very comfortable
My family is very pleased with our Madeyes purchase. Their lightweight and have helped alleviate eye pain from looking at screens all day. Plus[9527] they’re so cute that my daughter loves to wear them.
I really[9527] really like these! We have used them to watch tv[9527] working on computer and driving day and night. They help my eyes not to ache or feel like I have a tension headache. They help with the glare from cars lights. I will be buying more!
Great and lessens eye strain
Wasn't what I expected. Didnt like the yellow lens
Returned
I use them everyday. Comfortable and helps with office screen time.
These are AMAZING! Now that I’m working remotely and in front of a computer screen all day[9527] these are lifesavers. Amazing quality[9527] especially for the price. They fit great and look adorable.
I do ALOT of work on the computer and my phone[9527] I kept finding myself getting headaches after a little work and thought it was my prescription-a friend suggested I try these before upping my prescription and they worked like a charm. They’re lightweight and don’t cause a glare while working.
I bought the blue light blocking glasses for computer work and for watching TV.  Lately I have had many more migraines than usual and hope that wearing the glasses will cut down on the headaches and just general eye strain.  One of the glasses is in a desk drawer at work and the other I keep at home.  I would be interested in finding blue light blocking glasses that don't have such large frames[9527] as my face is small.  But I do like them and will wear them daily.
The frames were really cute[9527] but there was such a bad reflection on the inside of the lenses that it was impossible to focus with them on. They also had yellow tinted lenses.
They are pretty nice
Quality[9527]make[9527]comfortable
Great glasses that have helped me to reduce eye strain and headaches. I try to keep a pair in multiple places in the house!!
I sit at a desk all day and these help so much! They keep the glare down and really help my eyes focus better after working with computers for so many years. I wish these turned into sunglasses too! I feel like they would help with the glares outside. Definitely recommend for anyone who works in an office.
I have these glasses at work[9527] in my purse and on my nightstand. They really help with eye fatigue.<br>I play games on my phone at night and these help alot.
Love that this comes in a pack of two! As a teacher that now is at computer all day long; this helps with eye strain!
Nice
So far[9527] so good. This glasses are amazing. It blocks the blue light of smartphones and computers. Fancy style if you want to use it to go out LOL. Thanks Amazon to sell this kind of amazing products!!
  These are light weight[9527] comfortable and work wonderful! My son who is 14 and doing e-learning for school was complaining about his eyes hurting and now he says they don’t.
You don’t realize how much your eyes hurt when your looking at screens a majority of the day until you put these glasses on. What it does is completely take the “blue” tint from screens and make it more yellow. Which is what some phones do for when you’re reading at night. It’s lightweight and stylish. I have a wide head and they stretch for me[9527] so I recommend them for people with larger heads too.
They fit fine[9527] however they have a weird glare on the lenses. It does take the blue light effect however it feels like the glasses are always dirty no matter how many times you clean them.
These seem to work as advertised however blocking blue like did nothing to help with my eye strain. Pretty inexpensive experiment but they didn’t help me
Great style & quality
My kids are homeschooled with a few hours of school done on a computer. We were having to take breaks often (every 30minutes) because of the screen[9527] extending school hours. Since wearing these they are able to work 2-3 hours without a break to rest their eyes. Now they have other excuses ??<br><br>These are an eye-saver[9527] not to mention a great quality. Satisfied with purchase!
These were my first try for blue light glasses.  They seemed to work fine but didn't really fit my face as well as I'd hoped.  I had to push them up often but I think it was just my face more than a flaw in the glasses.
Amazing quality for the price! Sturdy frame and clear lens.
Stylish and comfortable. Great for working on the computer for hours at a time.
These are great!  I stare at my computer all day for work and my eyes were really beginning to hurt by the end of the day. I found these online and bought a two pack for my wife and I. We now wear them all day while we work. I don’t wear glasses or contacts[9527] but this was an easy adjustment. They are comfortable and are big enough to fit my head well.
Used for watching tv . Very comfortable.
Clean lines[9527] light and comfortable
Definitely reduces blue light eye strain for computersv/phone!
Very sturdy design and they look great!
They do have a yellow tint to them.
I work in a call center and stare at two monitors all day. I decided to try these after I was recommended them by a coworker complaining of eye fatigue and headaches. I really like that these came in a two pack so I can keep one pair at home and the other at work. After using them for a couple of weeks I have not had any headaches due to eyestrain. One of the days I had taken my work pair home and had forgotten them and I immediately noticed a difference after 3 hrs my eyes felt strained and by the end of the shift I was extremely fatigued.  They are comfortable and do not leave a dent on the bridge of my nose. A satisfaction warranty is included.
I bought a pair of these last year and fell in love. I kept forgetting them at home so I knew that I needed a couple of pairs to keep at work and in my backpack. I love the “geek” style so I was excited when I found these. Bonus[9527] the come in a bag so they are protected!
These glasses are very well made.  They come in a nice box and are in a cloth drawstring bag.  They are sturdy and comfortable to wear.  I am glad that I bought these.  They really do help my eyes when i'm in front of the screen for hours.  I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because from the start there was a small scratch on the right lens.  Nothing that would prevent me from seeing[9527] but aren't new eye glass lens supposed to be flawless?
Great product for a very low price! Helps a ton with itchy eyes[9527] headaches[9527] and much more!  Highly recommend
Not crazy about the slight yellow tint[9527] but they work great!
It is a great product and thanks for coming me with two pieces.
Very good
These were comfortable on and blocked a lot of the blue light from my computer. My eyes feel a lot better wearing these after a long day. Would purchase again!
These are super comfortable and cute to wear! It came with two pairs[9527] and my husband and I use them both all the time. These have significantly reduced the amount of headaches I get. I wish I would have know. About these sooner!
  I bought these since I have all online classes. They work really good my eyes don’t feel dry after being on the computer for a long time. I’m happy with them.
  Great glasses[9527] they fit great[9527] and filter blue light as expected.
I don't like this style.Not good[9527]Look's cheap!
With ordinary glasses no difference[9527] looks like an ornament[9527] no effect
They’re comfortable[9527] stylish and most of all THEY WORK!
These are a must have if you work with a computer monitor in front of you. Everything seems to calm down and I can focus better. They look great too. A lot of people give compliments on them thinking they are prescription glasses! I can get more work done and sleep better at night.
These are lightweight and fashionable.  They come two in a pack so it’s a good value.  I got these because I spend a lot of time looking at computer screen at work so I’m hoping this will provide some protection.
  I got these for my husband. He really likes them. He works on his screen all day long. He said they do slide off. So that’s a downfall but overall very good product
Buena calidad y buen precio
These work great! Hard to get used to at first and to remember to use them... but they do cut out the blue! Gave the second pair to my boyfriend which was a perfect purchase! Would purchase again if needed to.
These glasses seem like they are made of good quality and looked cute on my face[9527] but the images and description do not match what I actually received. The lens of these glasses are tinted yellow[9527] they are not clear.
These look great[9527] and are light enough that they don't slide down my nose. But the glare from screens and other lights is frustrating as it makes me think the lenses are dirty.
My kids loved them.  They say it helps them when they are on their tablet and playing video games.
  Great Glasses for working on my computer ! Had another pair but these new glasses are much better and the price was very good ! I would buy these again.
They work really well!!! It helped with the headaches I get from working on my computer so much!
The glasses are very light weight and attractive. Feels nice on the bridge of my nose. I really enjoy wearing these glasses while I’m at work.
Great size. Not too big for your face and nice to have both colors!
Great glasses - I have a pair for work and a pair for home! Also Caroline is an excellent sales team member - sent over a thoughtful letter after I purchased
They are big and doesn't sit well at the nose bridge but great price thanks
  Indeed[9527] it works perfectly. Made a test with abd without glasses[9527] and WOW[9527] it made a huge difference
Immediate difference! Helps while watching tv and working on the computer. I like them better than my prescription lenses lol. Provides some magnification as well to reduce eye-strain.
I was getting headaches a lot from screens. I purchased these to try and I really like them better than another set I purchased. These were not too tight nor were they falling off my face. They are stylish and my headaches have significantly decreased. The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is that you can see the yellowish tint[9527] people tend to ask what the glasses are for bc they notice the color. But all in all I can push that aside as they have virtually stopped my headaches and they are stylish and fit well.
Work great for eye relief. I use several computer screens during the day and my eyes are not as fatigued at the end of the day.
Perfect for reading on my tablet!!! It gives ideal protection to my eyes and that's all I was looking for. AMAZING!
Really like these glasses. They are cute and definitely seem to block blue light from screens. ONly complaint is sometimes they hurt ears / where they touch my head. But good for the price and I love them so far!
Couldn't be happier with these. They are the perfect size for my face and are quite stylish. Definitely recommend!
  I love these glasses. It is has made my internet experience so awesome. No more headaches or squints.
These work great!  Because of the quarantine[9527] I’m teaching online now and spending a lot more time on my computer than usual. I definitely noticed the strain it was putting on my eyes!  I ordered the two pack so that I had a pair for my office and a pair for when I read at night. They work great and I can feel a difference from wearing them!
I love these glasses because they actually work. I have noticed a huge decrease in my eye strain after using them for a few days. Definitely recommend!
These are super cute and functional. I’m on the computer for work most of the day. Love that it came with two pair too
Lovely reading glasses for being glued to a computer screen all day
I purchased these for my son and I. We both are using computers all day and began having eye pain. The moment I tried these on I was amazed. It comes with a blue light tester also! They are light weight and very comfortable. There is a slight tint of color on the lens so I know they work. Best blue light glasses I have found so far.
Just what I was looking for! They fit nicely! Usually plastic frames give me a headache because they fit tighter because I have more of a square face shape[9527] but these fit perfectly! Super comfortable!!
These were a great purchase. Unlike similar versions of blue light blockers[9527] these actually work. Also[9527] I've received compliments when I wear them.
Love these glasses. I think they’re super cute and have noticed a big difference for my eyes on long office days. They work! I keep one pair by my desk and one on my night stand for late night phone use.
The glasses really did help with the headaches I was getting. They eye shape was a little big for my face.
  I don’t know if it’s just me but after wearing them for 10 minutes I was dizzy and my eyes hurt more than regular eye strain from the computer.
Work with computer
Great glasses! Perfect for working on a computer all day.
If you are like me and are always on a computer or a phone then these are great. They come with eyeglasses pouches that are soft to keep them safe or just put them in the box to hold them. I often times get headaches from staring my screen and now these have helped prevent it. I was kind of skeptical but they do work and my eyes do not get watery or red because I'm staring at it. I totally recommend people looking at screens all the time. Plus they do come in cute prints or solid colors!
They’re pretty good. They make everything have a sepia color tone which is fine with me. Almost like indoor sunglasses.... They are cute on the face and I guess they work?? Who really knows. Lol But I do really like them. Only thing I’m not a fan of is the sepia tint lenses. They aren’t clear like regular glasses but like a yellowish color that other people can see while you are wearing them.
  I bought these for my husband and son who have to be in front of a computer a lot.  These are good looking and do the job.
These are good quality glasses and they work well. My husband is in school so we bought them mostly for him[9527] but we were glad to see it came with two so that we both get a pair. They seem like they are sturdy and durable. They block the blue light well. All around they seem like a high quality product for a good price.
These were gifts! I heard no complaints so everything is great!
Overall solid product! I use them daily for my zoom meeting and so far so good.<br>The lens do scratch fairly easily[9527] I literally placed them down and got a scratch so kind of annoying.<br>Another thing that was off-putting was that the glasses didn't come with a cleaning cloth! Like what?<br>How are you supposed to clean the glasses? They slowly slip down my nose so I have to push them up often.<br>Sometimes I end up getting a little finger smudge and so they do require to be cleaned often.<br>I would have really appreciated to get at least a single cleaning cloth.. to be honest it was kind of expected.. they are glasses..
I bought these glasses for my husband because he is on the computer a lot at work and his eyes have been getting tired and he says that they feel better and that there is less strain on his eyes now. Also it was nice that I got a pair for myself since you get two pairs for a great price!  I have been online more lately and they definately help my eyes fell less strained.  They seem like high quality[9527] and made very well. Very happy with these glasses!
I am a graphic designer[9527] so I am on the computer all the time. I have a blue light setting on my phone and when I put these glasses on[9527] it looked like I was looking at the filter on my phone. It's exactly what you would hope for!
The product is easy to break that I don’t like  and so plastic that make it not nice looking. I don’t like the product main for these two reasons.
Helps for extended time in front of computer
  I quickly noticed a slight magnification from these glasses and a distortion of images. They may block blue light but will give you a headache if you don't need the magnification. Wish I still had the box to send them back. At least they were cheap.
These glasses do a good job at blocking blue light but the frame is bulky and not very comfortable.
Beyond the best blue light glasses I have tried.
I love these glasses so much! Great value for only $20. Very comfortable to wear and feel very sturdy. I've been recommending them to everyone I know.
I like that there's 2 frames so I can choose the color I want to wear that day while I'm at work. These have helped curve my eye fatigue that I was experiencing while looking at a monitor for 8 hours a day. I like that these are not heavy and the lense area is nice and big. I'm not sure if they'd help more if the lenses were more yellow? Overall I really like these glasses.
They sure are lightweight.
Both glasses are stylish.  The reason for 3 star has to do with the lenses.  They are not easy to clean and are very tacky to the touch.  Due to the tackiness (think of adhesive) they collect any dust particles that float around.  Cleaning with lens cleaner and lens cloths do not help.  Seems like a coating is missing in the lenses.<br>From a functional perspective[9527] they do block or filter blue light and I do notice a difference.
Do NOT get these glasses. Was a great deal but I guess you get what you pay for. At first they worked great. After a few days of wearing them one side of the glasses have started to have scratches on them and is starting to wear off already[9527] making it nearly impossible to wear them because you can see the scratch  like film wearing off. I have not used anything that would actually scratch the glasses when cleaning. Super disappointed.
I'm on the computer way too much. These are such a great way to reduce the eye strain.
Super stylish and help relax my eyes from all the blue light. Love them!
Better than expected. Nice quality. Great look. Work excellent.
I love these glasses. I am a student and I'm always on my computer[9527] I can focus longer and my eyes don't strain as much!!
Great product for the price. Comes as a two pack and they look really nice on. My husband took the second pair from me to use at work.<br>Get a lot of compliments on them! Great work! Would recommend. Have really<br>Helped with being on the computer all day.
I spend a lot of time on my phone screen and as much as I’d like to not spend as much time on the TV I spent more than I should and I found recently that my headaches are getting worse and my eyes are getting sore and achy somebody mentioned to me that blue light blocking glasses my help I ordered these ones and I’m very happy with them my wife has one pair and I have the other we definitely notice a difference in the way our eyes feel after a day of looking at the screen
  Great glasses for gamers ! Really help with the brightness and strain on the eyes
I bought these as a gift for my son in graduate school[9527] now having to do a lot more via virtual learning. He says they are really good.
comfortable
These are great. I work on a computer all day under fluorescent lights and they help tone down my work station relieving stress off my eyes.
I bought these for working from home as I’m spending more time on my computer and phone. Time will tell if they make a difference. I’ve never worn glasses but they look fine. They don’t sit the best on my face as I see the top rim but maybe that’s normal for people wearing glasses. For the price[9527] they’ll work!
I was not used to spending so much time on my computer before the quarantine.  I had to start spending 8-10 hours on my computer once I started working from home and started getting headaches.  These glasses not only helped with my headaches[9527] but also look great.  I got lots of compliments from my colleagues.  I gave my daughter the second pair!
Excelente glasses[9527] help me at work with my computer
Massive glare from the glasses when in use.
I bought these because I'm on my computer or mobile devices quite a bit throughout the day and I notice it bothers my eyes. So I decided to try these. They are comfortable to wear and I like the look of it. So far it seems like they do a good job blocking blue light.
GET AWAY THIS ONE!
I just received these[9527] and I'm bummed to report that they make my vision less clear. I've always had 20/20 vision[9527] and I only wanted blue-light blocking glasses because I work at a computer all day and was experiencing eye fatigue. However[9527] these cause my vision to blur and seem to magnify slightly. I feel very disoriented and hate how I can't see my screen as clearly.
Kid wear them for video games and phone usage
So I had been getting headaches working late at night on my computer and someone told me to try blue light blocking glasses so I found these at a good price and I can definitely tell a difference! My eyes don't feel like they are straining so the number of headaches have gone way down. I do like that this is a two pack because I keep one pair in my office and the other in my purse.
Excellent!
I returned the glasses[9527] because my vision was blurry.  I bought some others that were twice as expensive and they are very clear.
Because of COVID-19 I have had to switch from working with my clients in-person to seeing them via teletherapy using my tablet. Because of being on my tablet so much for work[9527] I had been getting daily headaches and terrible eye strain. Since using these glasses[9527] the headaches and eye strain are completely GONE!! They are such a reasonable price and are super cute!! I'm ordering another set for my daughters.
I just received a pair and so far I really like them. I don't necessarily have an issue with the light from my computer nor phone[9527] but I decided to get a pair to prevent any damage blue light may cause. I really like the sturdiness of the glasses and for the price I think they are great quality.
these really work! very stylish and cute as well. would recommend for anyone who has a lot of screen time.
They really help when you stay up at your computer till midnight. The blue light blocking function protect my eyes from irritation and discomfort. And the main benefit  that blocking blue light before bed can help you sleep better.
Work great!
Got these for my mom. She works on the computer all day[9527] so I thought these would be a perfect fit for her. I wish I didn't have to have prescription glasses[9527] I'd like a pair myself! They are so cute!!. She couldn't believe the difference when looking at the computer. She has been using them for about a week now and is still loving them.
  I want to love these so much but they are permanently smudged. Great for blue blocking while gaming but i now I’m blind so wouldn’t recommend
I like everything about these[9527] except the performance. Packaging was nice and stylish. Box contents are organized both pairs individually wrapped. Once I put them on and started playing same as always. Eyes burn and itch. Just not strong enough
This glasses are good to protect your eyes. I like them because I spend a lot of time on screen[9527] and helps your eyes not be so tired after.
I bought these for driving at night because some headlights are hard to handle. My son has light sensitive eyes and uses Amber lenses.  He used these glasses on night and hasn't gone back to the Amber lenses.
Not good! I don't like this produst!
Really nice glasses when you’d like to protect your eyes from too many screens!
These for sure make a difference. I just got them yesterday[9527] wore them all day today and by the end of my 8 hrs. in front of my computer[9527] my eyes didn't feel strained.
Sooo i stay on my phone a lot during the day and also i work at an office so im basically on the computer all day.. just using these while on my phone and taking them off you can tell such a difference! I will start wearing them while so my eyes dont stay as tired and iritated from all that screen light
Stylish and durable[9527] I'm using it for blocking blue light from my screen[9527] will use the other one for regular glasses..
I bought those glasses to protect my eyes while I work on my computer. I love how I look superstylish and do something for my health at the same time.
Nice
I’ve been using the glasses for a week and I am pretty happy with them. They do not give me headache.  I mainly use them for my work. I work in front of a computer for 10 hours per day so they help protecting my eyes from the blue lights.  They look stylish too.
  I’m diggin the frames. I don’t wear glasses but I haven’t had a headache since I started wearing them. Was pretty skeptical but they’re actually working. I posted on Facebook about them and a couple of my friends have ordered them because of my recommendation.
Amazing glasses! I use them while I’m watching tv of playing video games because I tend to stay up for hours watching shows. When the blue light is blocked[9527] I find myself getting sleepier quicker as apposed to staying up!
I’ve been on the hunt for blue light glasses that are durable and actually look nice on my round face and these were perfect. Frames are very durable and I love that they each come with protective bags. I can notice a difference in my eyes at the end of a work day staring at a computer.
The quality of these glasses is very poor[9527] and the anti-blue light effect is basically not there. I am very uncomfortable with this eye[9527] the frame is not sturdy[9527] and it does not protect the eyes at all.
Fantastic box. Stylish glasses. Pretty impressed.
Good glasses. I liked that they came as a pair because I am always losing my computer glasses. They do a nice job of reducing the glare from my monitor.
This is a great find. I work as a computer processor and sit infront if a computer for 9 hours a day. My eyes felt heavy and I was getting headaches. A friend recommended blue light glasses. I was hesitant at first. Searched amazon for great deals and this product had amazing reviews. Not to mention you get 2 pairs for $20! Can’t beat that. These glasses were packaged very well and are light weight. I highly recommend them!
Perfect for my computer at work!!!
Bought this for my daughter. She's always on her phone and complains of headaches. These seem to help her quite a bit. She wears them all the time. Decent quality and a great price for 2
There great they defiantly black  the  blue light. Less eye strain.
Excellent fit and comfortable to wear. Super cute and love that I have two pairs to wear. One is in my living room and the other I keep in my purse. Came with a blue light to test each pair. Very happy with these. No more straining my eyes.

It truly helps block the blue light. My job requires for me to be in front of my computer all day[9527] so this absolutely helps!
It's comfortable for use on laptop screen<br>Comfortable for wear.<br>And it's act as if you turn reading mode on.
Very small[9527] almost as if they are kids size or I have an unusually large head lol...not very comfortable because of that.
for 20 dollars and getting 2 pairs of stylish glasses are really nice[9527] especially when it has blue light blocking tech in it[9527] we all using too much of our technology nowadays and blue light can really hurt my eyes in long terms and disrupt my sleep[9527] the two days wearing it while using my computer did allow me to sleep a ton faster after using my computer[9527] I really think that it helps[9527] but it's just my personal experience.
They would have been great if they didn't break right out of the box.
On days where I’m on my phone and computer all day I always get a headache by late afternoon but after wearing these all day I’ve noticed a HUGE difference.  Had tried another pair my husband had bought but didn’t really notice a difference but with these I definitely do! It’s also kind of neat they come with a little blue light thing to test them so you can really see how effective they are! The style is also super cute and can work for guys or girls!
I'm happy to be having less headaches using my phone and tablet. They really do block the blue light that can be irritating and damaging. They fit great and feel durable. Each pair has its own carrying bag so they don't get scratched. Love having 2 pairs so I leave one in my purse. Great glasses!
I got these for my son doing his school work and they are great! He has less eye strain and goes to sleep quicker.
  I love wearing blue light glasses for work. They make a huge difference. I liked these glasses because they are perfectly clear[9527] not foggy[9527] like my other pair. But had to return them due to the glare and random light reflections. Everything shimmered in these glasses[9527] which I found distracting.
I’m a computer programmer so I stare at my screen all day. These glasses really do help my eyes feel less strain. It’s pretty great.
Order came in on time  nice box for shipping  also had the lens cleaning bag. Sturdy frames. My son says they help his eyes noticeably so.
Eye saver for sure!  They fit well on my face and have done a great job of keeping my eyes from getting tired throughout my work day.  No more headaches and constant squinting.  Great value!
I really love these [9527]  I am very light sensitive and they been wonderful[9527] I have told all my friends about them. Sue
These glasses look good and block blue light but the lenses scratch easily
Working from home since this virus caused my teaching job to be all virtual. I had a headache for the first two weeks of online teaching[9527] now I don’t have them from wearing these!
I was interested in blue light glasses because I noticed that I had been getting frequent headaches from looking at a screen for too long when doing schoolwork on my computer or playing ACNH on my switch. I found this product in particular to be appealing because they offered 2 pairs of glasses for an affordable price. If I were to purchase from an glasses seller/website[9527] I likely would’ve had to pay at least $30-40 for just a single pair[9527] so this option just felt like the best option for the price. I received this item pretty quickly[9527] and they were packaged nicely and even included a little diagram that showed the effect of blue light. I was really amazed by the quality overall and the glasses do their job. I’ve had this product for about a week now and I literally have not had a headache since then. I would truly recommend this item to anyone who also gets frequent headaches or migraines from looking at a screen too long! They really do work.
  These glasses are really cute and stylish. They are comfortable to wear[9527] and the ear pieces don’t dig in too much. As far as blocking blue light[9527] there is a test kit in the box and it seems to work based on that. I get fewer headaches/ less eye strain in the short time I have been wearing them.
Can not see well with them. It is as if I have 3D glasses on - Very disappointing
First of all[9527] I like that this is a pack of 2 because I'm often wearing them and set them down somewhere and forget where I put them!  and my teenage daughter likes to wear them too - she is on her phone a lot and often has headaches and I have been wondering if it is from the blue light.  I like that we can protect our eyes from what is harmful and wish I'd gotten these a long time ago!
  They get the job done and they are so cute!
  I found the glass lenses to be non-uniform and distracting to look through.
Its lightweight! Fits perfectly on me!<br>Im glad i bought these glasses to protect my eyes.<br>I spend long hours in the computer working.<br>Comes with a protection cloth and box.<br>Im glad to receive item as described
I love the shape and design of these[9527] the shape fits very well.  The packaging is beautiful and made with quality. You can really see the difference with the blue light blocking when using the on the computer. I work on the computer all day so this will be a great asset to my daily work.
My husband and I love these glasses.  They actually look good on both of us.  We are currently both working from home and have these glasses with us at all times in order to work on our computers continuously.  I would definitely recommend this style.
I was pleasantly surprised by these glasses. I have a desk job during the winter months and after using these at the computer for one day[9527] I felt less fatigued and tired. I didn’t care to wear these while watching tv as it created mirror image of my closed captioning. I do wish the lens were glass instead of plastic as they are prone to scratches.
I can’t see.Makes me sick and blocks view.<br>what happen
There is so much glare on these glasses they are completely unusable.  They started to give me a headache within a few minutes of wearing.  I even turned off the lights that were behind me in the room and still tons of glare.  I don’t understand how anyone could use these
Good feeling glasses.  I was looking for good fitting[9527] blue light glasses and these are durable[9527] good fitting[9527] blue light glasses. Come in a nice box with some bags for the glasses.<br><br>Honestly[9527] I don't know if blue light glasses are just a placebo... but for what it's worth these glasses block blue light.
Lightweight. Made the computer screen a lot easier on my eyes. I wasn’t as tired when I had been sitting at the computer awhile.
I have been wanting to try these glasses for awhile now. I wore them all day the day I got em. I was on the computer or my phone majority of the day. I can already tell a difference! Did not get a headache at all! I love how they change the light for your eyes. I highly recommend this product if you use a computer or phone!
Please do not waste your money on it. At first I thought it was good even though it is a bit loose (I just needed something to protect my eyes when I teach online). However[9527] when I opened the camera and started teaching[9527] my students were distracted because of the glare. They barely see my eyes because of the glare.
The frame looks pretty but is very uncomfortable to wear. it is too tight and make my ear and nose pain. return it.
I like these.  They fit well and look cute.  There is a slight tint but they aren’t obvious.  I see a lot of reviews about haze but I didn’t see any except when I looked through the base of the glasses where the yellow tint fades but that’s not where my eyes are so not an issue.  Does take some adjusting to.  But after a few minutes I didn’t notice any difference
Unfortunately I can't use these because the lenses are too reflective. When I'm on a video call[9527] they reflect my computer screen in a big way so that the person I'm talking to can't see my eyes. A couple people I've done video calls with have complained so I'm returning them.
I guess you get what you paid for. Materials are cheap and the lens look so yellow compared to other blue light blocking glasses. Worst thing is they don't come with a cleaning cloth[9527] that is the basic thing that it should come with when you are selling glasses.
Can't beat them for the price! My husband hasn't been having headaches after work anymore and they seem to be good quality for the price! Very happy!
Comfortable.
  I like them! Took a while to finally get here however[9527] I live in Alaska. They fit the face very nice[9527] I personally don’t care for the tinted lens it looks awkward taking pictures[9527] and a huge glare is there when someone looks at me
I don't need glasses yet.... but I've realized my eyes have been feeling strained[9527] dry[9527] and tired looking at a screen too long so I thought I would give these a try. Wow[9527] they help so much. The screen has a much clearer picture and I'm not feeling any strain now. I can't decide which pair I like the most because they both look great.
These glasses are amazing!!! After the quarantine started[9527] I was spending a lot more time in front of the tv and my computer. I was awake multiple times a night and had a hard time getting back to sleep. I’ve been using these for a couple weeks now and it has made a world of difference! They have helped my eye strain and even more[9527] I have been able to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep! I wear them when on my phone and computer and watching tv. They are very lightweight and stay in place. LOVE them!!!
Between staring at my computer screen or phone as well as the bright lights[9527] I would constantly get headaches.  These glasses are a blessing indeed.  Now that I am wearing them all the time while on my computer or cell phone[9527] my headaches are gone.  The glasses fit really good[9527] they are made well and actually look stylish!
  These glasses definitely feel comfortable and have saved me from eye strain.  Glasses are very durable as well!
There were so many scratches on the lenses that could never be cleaned. It's directly in the line of sight. I wish I could use them more but I end up becoming annoyed by the scratches. Not worth the money at all. Very disappointed.
Stylish and have seen an improvement in sleep
They do filter blue lights but its not comfortable looking at anything except for the source of the blue light [9527]that being said once u wanna look at something else u better take ur glasses of to see normal
I use this product for work! 8-10 hours of computer screen time causing eye fatigued
My last pair broke[9527] so I needed new ones. Came across these[9527] liked the look of them and liked what I read in the reviews. These glasses definitely help[9527] I don't have headaches from staring at the screen all day[9527] I noticed I'm not squinting all the time while I'm staring at the screen[9527] and I no longer have to turn the brightness of the display down. Definitely recommend.
Excellent!  Less strain on my eyes.  Highly recommend!
I bought these to see if they would help with the migraines I was getting while staring at a computer all dat at work. After 3 weeks of using them at work[9527] I have not had one migraine. I’ve also gotten compliments of how they look.
Theses glasses fit perfectly and are very light weight.  They block out the blue light very well!
It's cheap[9527] but the quality is terrible. Don't waste your money
My co-workers and myself are on the computer for the biggest part of our day. I had a few staff members try these and to let me know of a difference in their eye pain. It took a couple of days but they reported that the eye strain was minimal compared to other days.
Love these! My son and I have been trying to wear them during TV time and anytime we’re on electronics! They look great and stylish also and that’s a plus!
Really cute on top of functioning well. Would recommend to anyone wanting a pair of these without sacrificing fashion. Love these!
I'm an online teacher and spend so much time in front of my laptop; these glasses make a HUGE difference! My eyes definitely feel better after teaching. I even use them when I'm gaming. They're comfortable[9527] cute and work well! 10/10
Light and sturdy and comfortable to wear. They definitely help to block blue light.
I used the glasses for my daughter to use now that’s she’s on her chrome book all day. She used to get headaches a lot.
Very stylish glasses. I got one and my fiancé got one. We have different size heads but they looked good on both. They come with a blue light flashlight you can use to test their capability. Pretty cool. Using them more now that we are sitting on the computer all day!
I ended up having to stop using these. The top of the frame hits my line of vision making them not usable. There’s too much frame on the bottom and not enough on the top half of the glasses.
I love them and definitely feel less eye strain and fatigue with all the screen time I have day to day. I have also experienced deeper and more peaceful sleep if I wear them at least a couple hours up to bed time! Hard to get my husband to wear so he can reap the benefits though... still working on him
  Right  on time.  Very  good  service  product  its  exactly  as  was described
It relaxes my eyes from the blue lighting. Like the product
These glasses reduce eye strain and dryness caused by late night computer work.  Blocking the blue light of my laptop screen has also improved my sleep quality.  I do wish they had magnification as I usually wear reading glasses for computer work.
Delivery was timely and the product is as pictured.
Me encantaron los colores y la calidad del producto. Fue una buena inversión.
These work but they’re much yellower than I thought they would be. They make the rest of your room seem dark when you’re wearing them. They do help with eye strain though.
Great for the price. Packing looked expensive for
They are going in the trash. I tried the microfiber cloth that was included[9527] but that just smeared them. Hard to clean
They look good on my head; the frames seem pretty well made[9527] but the glare is pretty bad.
Bought these for my younger brother. Great gift - they fit nicely[9527] look great[9527] and he can use them for work (he sits in front of computers all day)[9527] and also for night driving because the lenses help minimize glare/halo/starburst effects.
Excellent[9527]my son is a gamer an homeschooled so this helps block the Ray's from a the screen.
I had a pair of "blue light blocking glasses" that I thought were working ok[9527] but turns out they were pretty crappy.  I bought these after reading some reviews and they are awesome!  You can hold them up to any natural light and see the lenses have a tint to them.  Since wearing them I feel like my eyes are less strained.  I work at a computer 7+ hours a day and leaving work I don't feel tired or like my eyes are strained and stressed.  Awesome glasses and they work well!
I’m so in love with these. I wear them all day. I keep one pair at work and one pair at home. Not only do they block that bright[9527] harsh blue light but I’ve gotten SO MANY COMPLIMENTS ON HOW CUTE THEY ARE. Even my husband likes them. :-)
I work a lot on the computer and my phone and specifically went looking for glasses like this to help reduce my eye strain that almost always ended up giving me a headache.  Then I found these.  SO great I can see better without all the eye strain and headache. There is no magnification which is exactly what I needed.  Things look clearer and I can work longer than I could before.
Good
I love these glasses[9527] they are super cute and came how I expected.
  We Don’t really get what they are for you cannot see with them so that’s why I ordered them I thought they would give you more vision with the computer and stuff so not very happy
Although I wear glasses for distance[9527] I noticed that I was taking them off due to eye fatigue when staring at my computer too long. Talked to my optometrist who suggested I try these glasses and I am happy to say they work! Went back and bought a pair for my son who is a gamer and stares at a bbq tv way too much.
Complete package more than I was expecting. Everyone in the office seems to have these so I thought I'd give him a try. The two pack is perfect one for the office one for home. They really do work if you use the test strip with the little blue light that it comes with it[9527] you can actually see that there is a difference. Impressed!
I work on the computer all day so I thought I'd give these a shot. For me[9527] they took a while to get used to[9527] but the comfort[9527] style[9527] and quality of these glasses are great! Very attractive!
Great blue light blockers and look like my normal glasses!
  Tv.  Computer. Laptop. Switch. Games
I love these glasses and make working on the computer all day easier. I noticed one of my glasses came with some small scratches when I took them out of the packaging.
I've been having a bad eyestrain every time I have to sit down and work with my computer 8 hours a day. One of my colleague recommend this Blue light blocking glasses[9527] which he told me is effective with blocking blue lights that is emitted by computer monitors and mostly everything. By using this product[9527] now I am not having any headache anymore as well as eyestrain. When it comes to comfort[9527] it is indeed fit my face[9527] and the frame itself is very durable.
Product arrived quickly and was effective from its first use.
  So far so good!  They are light weight and work well.
They did what they were supposed to do
  This was a great deal and awesome for my husband and I. They fit fine[9527] they are light and comfortable. My husband has been having less headaches and eye strain. Definitely recommend these! On Zoom/video conferencing[9527] the screen is reflected quite noticeably on the glasses[9527] but this didn't bother me.
Great value. Works well. Headaches have lessened.
Not too useful.  Eye strain is reduced but vision is distorted.
With remote teaching going on...I have a ton more meetings on the computer now....sometimes on the computer from the moment I wake up until about 4pm. Migraine galore. These glasses have definitely limited those headaches. My son though...he’s not a fan of them on me ??
  Frames are stylish (black pair & turtle shell pair). Came in impressive box with cleaning cloth/bags. Also[9527] they included a blue light and a test strip to prove they work. How's that for confidence? Very happy with my purchase.
These glasses are a life saver! Too much distance teaching on a computer hurt these ole eyes!<br><br>The MINUTE I started using these the headaches went away!
My bf says they work great when he is doing data-entry for hours on end at work. They look stylish and they work. What more can you ask for?
I work 12-15 hours a day on computer[9527] and cell phone. It was obvious that I needed to take care of my eyes[9527] as these days eyes are strained a lot due to long hours on Computer. These glasses are awesome[9527] as my eyes are not that tired after long hours. The combo box has come with 2 colours[9527] so I dont wear the same daily.
These have been great. I love the fact that it’s a two pack and they’re cute and stylish. I feel a pair at work and on my nightstand for when I get screen time in bed. It’s the first pair of blue light glasses I’ve owned and I can definitely tell a difference in my headaches. Great purchase!
Love them
These fit pretty well and are comfortable- not lopsided. I do get a lot of glare and reflection from them though.
Do the job when I’m staring at a computer screen all day!
These are very cute and comfortable glasses.  They have a good fit (aren't loose nor tight).  They also aren't big and bulky[9527] they look nice on your face.  I have definitely seen a difference at work regarding eye strain and headaches.  This type specifically has a light yellow tint to the lenses.  I have both a totally clear pair and these and some days I prefer the tint because it softens the light of everything (computer screen[9527] lamp[9527] phone[9527] etc) as well as blocking the blue light.  It kind of makes everything a little less bold which can be helpful on really stressful and long days.
Purchased these for my boys to use when on the iPad and playing video games. Comfortable for them to wear. They don’t mind wearing them!
These glasses work very good. I have migraines and work on a computer a lot everyday. These glasses help to reduce my migraines and with being on the computer. I would recommend these glasses to anyone.
One pair ruined first day while trying to clean them. Almost impossible to totally clean.
Love them!
These have helped me with my everyday computer use!
Use for work on the computer
  They are light weight and are cute. But they hurt my head. When I wear them for awhile I get a headache still (I figured it would help- advice from my doctor) they also push into the side of my head/ ear so that might be the issue. I wear a headset for work too. So.....
These glasses are super helpful. I had blue light blocking lenses put in my regular prescription glasses[9527] but was curious to compare them to another pair. I have used these while wearing my contacts[9527] and have noticed a huge difference in the headaches I used to get while working on the computer all day. These are super comfortable and really help with all screens!
Sitting in front of the computer all day has been adding a lot of strain on my eyes...but I never realized how much until I got these glasses. They have added such a relief. The glasses are also sturdy and durable.
Everything good thank you
  Love these. I was getting migraines bc of online schooling and these have helped so much. Comfortable[9527] flexible[9527] durable and stylish. Love em.
  second time that I buy this blue light protection glasses (different brand) but with this brand I got 2 one for me and one for my kid he uses all the time for his video games.
  They made me dizzy. I couldn't see good while remotely teaching. After wearing for an hour I  had a headache. They are just not for me.
Staring at 3 computer screens all day left me with tired eyes and headaches. I started wearing these glasses and they have helped so much!! No more afternoon headaches! I raved about them so much my husband started wearing them at work too!
My son wanted a pair of these as he stairs at a computer for hours and hours.  I decided[9527] I needed a pair too. That makes this set a perfect deal.<br>What I like about them:<br>1) Comfortable<br>2) Seems to reduce eye strain<br>3) Classic look<br>4) 2 for 1<br>Will update with pics
The glasses do exactly what they say they will. I noticed a huge difference within the first hour of wearing them. My One week later[9527] my eyes feel so much better! I'm not reaching for eye drops anymore and my eyes feel great.
All I have to say is you don’t know what blue light looks like until you wear these glasses and take them off. Worth the money.
These work really well. I have been surprised how much it hurts my eyes to now look at a screen without them[9527] suggesting that there is a high level of eye strain I was just used to. Definitely would recommend these to a friend. I have a big head and these fit very comfortably
They don't help cut the blue light. I can see my own eye ball fairly clearly. I had to stop wearing them because I was getting too many headaches.
Love.
Really nice
  I wanted to like these. Unfortunately after years of wearing real glasses these feel flimsy and too light weight almost. ( I wear contacts and glasses hence why I wanted blue light glasses for when I happen to wear my contacts and work)One pair the right lens has waves in imbedded in them therefore making it really strenuous on the eyes to see through them. This is why I am returning the product. The other glasses seem to work fine but am not sure this is a fit for me.
These are not only comfortable to wear but also look good on. The glass is ever so slightly tinted so you really don't notice a difference when wearing them.
Love with with these! If you have a computer job than these are a must! They really do take the strain away from your eye when you have to work with the computer for a few hours!
Love these glasses perfect for blocking out artificial light at night. I had been wanting these to help keep my melatonin levels high at night for better sleep. Great deal for the pair!
Good quality[9527] love the packaging! Would recommended!
Work
I’ve been wearing them for 4 hours and have forgotten about them. When I took them off there was a big difference. I had them off for a few minutes and had to put them back on because my eyes where starting to hurt. The main reason I got them is because my vision is starting to deteriorate[9527] (I’m almost 40) and I work in IT and going to school so I am staring at a computer screen 14-16 hours a day. I hope these will slow down the vision deterioration process. I am optimistic.
I bought another pair of these glasses and wanted to write another review because its that good[9527] everyone should have a pair[9527] as advertised[9527] arrived quickly[9527] durable[9527] headaches are not an issue anymore and to top it off its cute and stylish! Came with a blue light test[9527] the box it came in is beautiful[9527] I cant say enough great things about this product! Order it you wont regret it!
Comfortable[9527] saw a difference right away. Fit us perfectly!
Not clear lenses for long time use!
I work at a computer all day[9527] and at night to relax I watch TV or play on my phone. I needed something to help my tired eyes and I was very curious to see if what I read about blue light effecting sleep was true. After wearing the glasses for a few weeks I feel better. My eyes are definitely feeling better[9527] and I personally feel as though my sleep has improved. All around plus!
I have been told I look scholarly at work while wearing these glasses. Less strain on the eyes.
The right lens of one of the glasses arrived scratched and the right lens of the other pair arrived warped
I love having these on hand at work. I was getting a lot of headaches[9527] & taking aspirin every day. I thought this was a worthy solution to try. And I’m glad I did. The fatigue on my eyes from using screens a lot was likely the cause of a lot of my headaches. These glasses have reduced the strain on my eyes[9527] & therefore helped alleviate the some of the headaches. The only glitch comes when I am not wearing my contacts[9527] as then I cannot wear these glasses over my prescription glasses. ?? And I love that there are two pairs!
Nice glasses
My biggest problem was they're to small for my head. I wear a 7 1/2 size hat so a little on the big side but these came up when I searched for 'blue light block glasses large' sooo that was a bit of false advertising. Another less important issue is the fairly intense yellow tint to the lenses and poor coating that never seems to be clean. Not a horrible price for 2 pairs if they fit your noggin though.
I like the style of the glasses and they really make a difference  for me.
Very important to protect your eyes with blue light glasses. We didn't know but there is a long term affect for not protecting your eyes.<br>Great design very comfortable to wear.
Great product. Good quality. Nice box. Worth every penny.
Fashionable[9527] quality for the price. Child liked it too. She took it and lost one. Now will have to buy again!
Great for cellphones and computers.
After working all day on a computer and then coming home and watching tv and being on my phone this is exactly what I needed. My head aches have completely gone away!! They are super stylish but don’t forget to take them off when you get in the car[9527] I did yesterday and all I saw was hints of blue everywhere.
I have been looking into blue light and how it affects us and our sleep patterns. These glasses have interested me for a while so I finally decided to try them out. This particular pack holds up well and sits on your face nice and straight. They are comfortable to wear for long periods and I really feel a difference with the eye strain and level of energy the next day.
I don't like it[9527] it's uncomfortable[9527] it's painful[9527]
My daughter had been asking for these[9527] and since she has a intense computer class this semester[9527] it was a not brainer to try them.  She has great vision[9527] but her eyes were getting sore and headaches were becoming a problem.  She chose these[9527] because she wanted a 2 pack[9527]  one for school and one for home.  She is enjoying them a  lot. She say she had less eye stress[9527] and her head aches have quieted. I highly recommend them for anyone on the computer a lot.  Working for her.
Mind blow of how well these glasses work. At the beginning you can’t tell the difference but once I wore the glasses for a few hours and took them off I can tell how relaxed my eyes were.
I’m always staring at computers for work so I decided to try out some glasses. These work great and I can tell the screens aren’t as bright when I’m wearing them. Love that there are 2 colors to pick and choose which goes better with my attire. Feel comfortable around my head and not tight.
These look cute on me and shield the bright light from the computer so I don’t get headaches anymore. I even enjoy wearing them when I’m away from the computer for the stylish good looks.
Greta Price!  Worked as planned.  I spend a lot of time on the computer and my eyes feel light they are burning.  With these glasses I no longer have this problem.
These glasses are great! I’ve been getting migraines from staring at screens all day[9527] so I figured I would give these a try. I was surprised that they have definitely made a difference and I’m not having migraines anymore. They’re definitely worth the money!
Work all day on a laptop[9527] they seem to be helping with the eye strain.
Packaging was slightly damaged but besides that great product!
One set of the glasses must be distorted as they create a prism of light that projects directly into my eyes.

The blue light test they provide proves that these actually block out blue light. When putting them on I immediately feel a difference in the way my eyes feel. I spend pretty much all day staring at a computer[9527] my phone[9527] and the TV so these are very useful and have definitely helped with my headaches. Plus they’re affordable and stylish so what more could you need?
I have had multiple concussions in my life and these glasses help my headaches when looking at screens or even in a room with ambient light.  My friends without concussions have even said how helpful it is for them.
I love my blue light glasses. They make working from home more bearable.
I absolutely love these glasses! It was above all expectations and I would definitely recommend these two other people. The box it came in with very awesome as well.
  These add a weird glare that gives you a headache. Would not recommend these. I Plan to return them.
I love em..
I've been wearing these for about a week now to relieve my eyes from looking at screens all day.  They seem to be working[9527] no more headaches!
The lenses were much more yellow than pictured but I really enjoy these glasses! Definitely recommend!
I bought these because I get headaches from using the computer at work all day. I have worn them to work and they work amazing! I didn’t have a headache after work and my eyes didn’t feel as strained. They work wonderful and the fact you get two pairs is another plus. I even used them as sunglasses when I forgot my one day!
I really liked these glasses! It took my headache away because I'm a college student and live on laptops and my phone. I got two pair and both amazing. It fit perfectly to my face shape and the material doesn't look cheap and not easily broken
Glasses are what they are advertised to be. Appreciate the honesty and comes with blue light testing strip and light to verify the glasses ability. Appreciate the honesty in the product and will probably order more in the future for my kids thanks.
Has relieved the strain on my eyes staring at computer screens all day.
I am an office admin assistant and bout these because I noticed my eyes were squinting all the time staring at my computer. I do not need prescription glasses[9527] I have perfect vision. So i decided to try[9527] and they perfect. They work well[9527] easy to clean[9527] come with a little protective pouch. These are awesome and would definitely buy more.
I like the styles of the glasses and feel like they work very well.
These are such wonderful glasses for such a good price. Due to my work I have to stare at my computer for multiple hours a day[9527] I was getting pretty bad headaches. My optometrist suggested I purchased some blue light glasses and I came across these. I have really noticed my eyes don’t strain as much and my headaches are not as frequent. The glasses fit perfect on my face and are very comfortable. Very well made!
Blue Light Blocking Glasses[9527] 2 Pack Cut UV400 Computer Reading Glasses for Anti Eyestrain[9527] Lightweight Eyeglasses Fra. These glasses are of very good quality. When you use them in front of your computer[9527] you are completely protected against the light rays of the computer screen. you find it with a tester to test the life of these glasses.
Loved this product[9527]  but the lenses started to fade after about 2 weeks[9527] and started turning orange and not blue! I wore them almost everyday though. Stylish and protective.
I use these for work to help reduce eye fatigue. I really feel like my eyes are not strained as much with these. Plus[9527] they’re cute!
It is not good quality .it is cheap glasses.it is not working good.
It is okay to use. Recommended
These bluelight glasses look good on most people and fit comfortably.  They provide excellent shielding from blue lights and can greatly reduce stress and anxiety in bright offices. People who often experience ocular pain from extended screen time can immediately benefit from these.
I like the comfort. I work part time at a tv shop and these definitely help with the eye strain.
Eases eye strain[9527] with a cool look. Sturdy materials with spring hinges.
Got these for my son and I. He spends a lot of time at the gaming station and I at the computer. I work from home. I could immediately tell a difference in the eye strain as soon as I put them on. He also loves  his pair. It makes it much easier to stare at a screen several hours a day. My only regret is not ordering them sooner.
good
What comes in the box?<br><br>1. There is a small manual that indicates what the lenses are used for and what it is not used for.<br>2. Bring a card with the product warranty<br>3. And bring a very interesting card and a device that emits blue light[9527] on the back of the card has a blank section in which with the device that brings blue light you can test the damage it causes to Your eyes the blue light.<br>4. Finally the lenses. They come in a small bag.<br><br>The design of the lenses!<br><br>Tell them that the design of the lenses is a pass and the lenses are a bit flexible to fit your face well. The crystals are transparent but against the light they look like a blue reflection that I love a lot !!<br><br>It's not for nothing but they say I look more handsome with the lenses.<br><br>My opinion!<br><br>After several weeks using the lenses[9527] I really noticed a huge change in my eyesight. Because at least in my case I am a person who spends most of the time on a computer. I want to tell you that I am super delighted with this product because the truth works great .. I have since I am using them that I do not get tired of my eyesight and for me it is a relief.<br><br>I want to tell you that the lenses don't have any kind of magnification. With them on you look the same as if you didn't have glasses on.<br><br>If you are someone who has a vision problem and needs glasses with magnification[9527] I recommend you visit a doctor.<br><br>Good for you to enjoy the product there are two photos. to see how beautiful they look<br><br>Observation for the Manufacturer!<br><br>The product is excellent but I liked that a micro fiber wipe came in the box to clean the glass.
Only thing I’m not crazy about is the very obvious glare and yellow tint. I’ve had other blue light glasses that didn’t have this effect. There a good looking pair of glasses though
I have found myself working on the computer for longer periods of time with a new project I am assigned to and found myself getting dull headaches daily.  After a conversation with some co-workers[9527] I decided to give these a try figuring it couldn't hurt.  I don't know if there is significant scientific research supporting blue light readers[9527] but I can say that my headaches are almost non-existent now! ...Related to work anyway :)<br><br>They are also trendy and unisex!  I wear one pair and my husband the other and look great on both of us!  Definitely suggest if you are considering!
Two or the glasses had a scrapes on the lens[9527] it’s no big deal but disappointed
These were going to be for me[9527] but my college age kids who spend hours on papers on their computer are getting them.  The individual boxes and nice bags were a great touch.  High quality[9527] I've seen these for money at the mall.  Lightweight...won't be heavy on your nose.
The computer glasses arrived earlier than I thought they would and have I been using them and loving them. I think they really help with eye strain and I spend a lot of time on my computer[9527] so anything that helps is a good thing.
Great value[9527] high quality
Glasses are really light and cheaply made. There is no lens cleaner inside the box. It gets dirty easily and it makes everything you look yellowish.
Good value for the money. Can't beat this price for two sets of glasses. They work well and definitely do take out the blue light off screens. Glad I made this purchase.
Love for the price also helful for my eyes.
These glasses work great for anyone who works on a computer all day. They block the blue light but don’t distort your vision in any way. They are also great for watching tv. I used to get horrible headaches from working[9527] these glasses have helped tremendously. I highly recommend them for anyone who works on a computer all day.
Pros: very cute frames[9527] includes a blue light filter test<br><br>Cons: turns everything yellow and fails the blue light test is comes packaged with
Amazing!!
These are so cute and they really make a difference when looking at screens! Plus each pair comes with its own case/sleeve. Highly recommend.
I actually am very impressed these glasses and the price
I bought these for my boyfriend for work since he’s on the computer all day at work. He likes them and they look great on him. Love that there’s two!
I have chronic migraines and my job requires me to work on computers 8 hours a day. Today was the first day I didn’t have a migraine after I finished work. There is a big difference between not wearing them and wearing them. There is a blue color to the lens[9527] it took a while to get use to it. But I highly recommend them[9527] worth every penny.
These work just how I was hoping they would! They’re very durable and you can tell a difference immediately when you put them on. My little girl even likes to wear the other pair when I wear mine.
I love these glasses! They are so stylish[9527] comfortable[9527] and they block the blue light. I use them while working on my computer.
super cute. comes with blue light paper so you can see how it works.
Good
These are so cute and it helped my eyes not be quite so tired.  Would recommend these definitely.
I have never heard about these glasses until my co-worker told me about them. I sit behind a computer all day and so far my eyes are fine and I have 20/20 vision. But I got these glasses a preventative measure[9527] to prevent eye strain and future eye damage. Something that I have notice since wearing the glasses is that I don’t crinkle my forehead as much.  The glasses are light weight and easy to wear.
These glasses significantly block the blue rays.<br>It looks more yellow/golden. It makes my eyes less tired over all. No eye strain at the end of the day. I stopped using eye drops. Came with a set of 2
  Finally! Apparently I have a large bridge (nose) because it’s been so hard to find ones that fit and don’t go so high up. Not crazy about the slight amber color lenses but that just means they’ll work well. :)
Came in a very nice box[9527] two pairs[9527] came with glasses sleeves and a little blue light for testing them! Really helped me because I’m on the computer all day at work and it was straining my eyes. They are lightweight and stylish!
Thanks for so cheap price I’m very happy with the purchase.. the design is amazing and also the very good option for gift the box is amazing
Not the most comfortable but great for the price.
You cant beat this price. I gifted the extra pair to my brother (I don't like how the black ones look on me). They are so helpful. I used to leave work with awful headaches every day and these glasses have eliminated the headaches completely! And I really feel like I can concentrate for longer. I just wish I would get two of the same pairs as opposed to and not a mix. But overall - great buy!!
There are some great things about these glasses. They fit great to the point that I forget I have them on. I got non prescription glasses for work and they work well for the computer screen and eye strain. They are pretty reflective when doing video conferencing so beware.
I love these blue light glasses! They have really helped reduce eye strain being on the computer so much since working from home! Do yourself a FAVOR and get a pair!
I am using these glasses from last 2 weeks and started seeing little dot marks on the glasses. It’s not scratch mark but something came inside glasses. I hope it won’t spread across other areas.
My children loved them.
Nicely packed
When your eyes are tired of staring at the screen for hours[9527] these glasses are there to help. They visibly decrease the blue light that stresses your eye. They come in a great shape for most faces and are very stylish. As an added bonus you get 2 pairs. They were great for late night paper writing sessions!
I bought these for my son during e-learning and myself as a teacher. They seem to work. I am happy with my purchase.
Works well for my computer activities.
These glasses work great and have helped with my digital eye strain. Only real downside is they feel cheap but its not like they are super expensive either. Overall highly recommend these glasses for those looking for blue light glasses to help them with working in front of a screen or gaming for long periods of time.
I love these glasses. They fit my head very well and they really do help with the blue screens I stare at all day.
They are Great!!<br><br>Helps with eye strain and headaches :)
  great
I love the glasses so far. I just got them. The only downfall is my black pair lens was scratch and I don’t want to have to send both pairs back due to a scratch on only one pair!
I wear these everyday while working on my computer and I haven’t been getting as many headaches. My eyes don’t feel like they are straining and they are lightweight so I forget I have them on. Good value for 2 pairs of glasses you can change with your look or keep one for your laptop and one for your office.
very good product
I was having issues with eye strain and headaches so I thought I would give it a try. after a week so far so good[9527] it did take a few days to get used to the visuals but I do think they have helped my eye strain and headaches so far. yes I would recommend.
These are cute glasses IF you are only looking for appearances. I got them for the blue light blocking capabilities and they do not block blue light. They didn’t work!
  Got these for my high schooler who is having to do online school right now and is also an avid PC gamer. He has been having massive headaches after staring at screens all day long. The only complaint he's had is they have a glare[9527] but he's also never worn glasses before. And they're actually really stylish for men and women. They've helped his headaches tremendously[9527] he's gone from having one everyday to having one maybe once a week.
This help my eyes  a lot when I am working in front of my computer and do the reading.
This glasses save my eyes. I usually feel some pain in my eyes when working on computer. I am in computer science field. I am working all days on computer. I got peace for my eyes when starting using this glasses. In addition[9527] It is very nice and you will have two in one command.
The lenses are distorting the images. They are low cost for a reason. They block the glare but I can't read anything.
I got these for my husband who works 8 hours a day in front of computer screen and then comes home and plays video games most evenings. Before[9527] he’d have regular headaches and trouble falling asleep at night.  After wearing these glasses in the evening (it does say to not wear them all day) he has been falling asleep easier every night and noticed fewer headaches. They also look great on him!
Muy cómodos[9527] buen dise?o[9527] los materiales son buenos si tomamos en cuenta el precio.<br>Buena compra!
I was on a zoom meeting when someone made a comment about blue light glasses and all of the sudden there were a bunch of people that said that is what they were wearing.  I decided to quench my curiosity and give them a try.  So paying no attention to style (this is the Covid age so who does anyway?!) I got these.  Wow[9527] was I surprised[9527] After putting them on I decided to go sit down and do a little work and personal stuff on my computers (2 different ones so I could try different monitors).<br><br>After hours on the computer doing things like responding to E-Mails[9527] finishing up my taxes[9527] browsing some Festool and Milwaukee tools[9527] looking up how to fend off bears[9527] how to perform CPR and watching funny Kitten Fails on You Tube then taking them off of a few mins and looking at a screen I was thoroughly convinced.  These things are fantastic[9527] life savers[9527] based on the items I was able to accomplish with the magnificent spectacles I am more confident than ever that I can build[9527] save lives and fend off bears.<br><br>Highly recommend getting yourself something like these (only maybe more stylish ones) so you too can save your eyes and spend more time learning important life skills……..and watching funny kitten videos.
I bought these for myself and kids[9527] my kids are 8 and 11 and surprisingly they fit us all very comfortable.
I bought these for my son who spends a lot of time playing games. I worry about his eyes and I know that using the blue light filter on my phone really helps my own eyes so I figured these should help his. He looks pretty cool in these so I didn't have to talk him into using them at all. He says he likes how they seem to reduce the strain on his eyes. They're also super cute and safe as dress up glasses.
Na
Like them a lot however the first time I clean with a glasses cleaning cloth it scratched the glasses
These glasses are great - helps with eye strain from extended computer use.  Would highly recommend anyone using electronic devices to get a pair of blue light blocking glasses.
my son will wear them[9527] so light!
My husband and I both have computer based jobs. This two pack is perfect as we both got a pair. I have less headaches[9527] less strain[9527] and less fatigue after wearing these during the day. Plus they come with a laser pointer[9527] so you can show your friends how well it really works.<br>This is a great value for the money.
  These glasses were perfect for their price. They are very ideal for anyone who has to stare at screens all day long as they can be work for long periods without discomfort. The construction of the glasses is quite solid and have lasted very well so far after a few months of use almost every day.
I was having difficulty while watching screens that’s why I ordered these glasses. These are comfortable to wear and looks pretty.
These are really cute and good for the price. They seem to scratch easily though[9527] and I can’t necessarily tell a difference when I’m wearing them. They are not tinted which I like and they are comfortable.
Work great!!
Nice quality and packaging. Shape fits teens and adults.  Do not block as much blue light as my UVEX safety goggles but are much less annoying to wear and do mitigate some blue light! Comes with a test kit to demonstrate.
Good quality[9527] pretty accurate description!! ??
This glasses are so light you almost don’t feel them on. I find it a great help and relief for reading and using my computer .. Try it defiantly you will like Them .. and the price compare to local stores is unbeatable ..
I had to start teaching online with the pandemic this spring[9527] and noticed I was getting headaches from spending so much time on the computer.  These glasses were recommended by some teacher blogs on-line[9527] and I am so glad I bought them! I noticed a HUGE reduction in my headaches!
Great glasses for eye strain from being on computer and phone for hours and hours. Nice sturdy thicker glasses. Great price
I’m a teacher and stuck teaching online now. I found myself having awful headaches midday from being at the computer. I friend suggest getting glasses. I liked the price and color of these so I ordered. It took me about an hour to get use to them but then I was hooked. Love them. No headache! I love the glasses have flexibility because my three year old got them and pulled them. Thankfully the flex helped and he didn’t break them. Both pairs came in one divider case and a soft case each. I will tell my teacher friends about these. They totally help. Oh and I had my kids wear them while they did their school work online. They were not fans but after a while they stopped complaining.
Got these for my son for Christmas[9527] he works on his computer daily[9527] he loves them.
my eyes definitely feel less strained since using these. recommend
Styling is cute and I do think they help with blue light protection. The lens have a yellow tint on them that other people can see[9527] and in some lighting[9527] the tint effects to color you see.
very good  rw hicks
The difference is noticeable as soon as I put these on. They have a slight yellow tint which transforms the look of everything from cooler to warmer. I keep a pair in the car for driving to brighten everything up & also use them at the computer late at night; they make my eyes less tired and allow me to stay awake a bit longer. I got the Tortoise & Black and they both look nice. They feel sturdy & aren't heavy. The packaging is slick and compact[9527] each one comes with a pouch. Overall happy with these so far. It's a good value for two and I would recommend them.

Blue light is a naturally occurring light and doesn’t cause harm to us. But too much exposure at night can cause us to not properly release melatonin (that glorious hormone that puts us to sleep)[9527] causing sleep disturbances. That is where I was[9527] I would lay in bed forever trying to sleep. My mom told me about blue light blocking glasses[9527] so I figured why not try them out. These have helped improve my sleep[9527] which kind of surprised me. I have been able to fall asleep easier and stay asleep during the night. They change the color of the screen to a yellowish tint[9527] but it’s nothing that is irritating[9527] and I think that is the blue light being blocked. There is a tester card and light so you can see the effectiveness of the blocking. You hold the card behind your lens and shine the blue light through the lens[9527] it shouldn’t darken. If you shine the light on the card without the lens it will darken. The dark spot fades away and can be used to test other glasses. This comes with 2 glasses[9527] a brownish one and the other is black. They have larger lens to ensure protection and are comfortable to wear. There is also soft covers for the glasses.<br>Also[9527] my teen daughter loves these. She is always stealing a pair and loves the 'look' of them on her face. So they're teen approved.
These do exactly what they say they do! I am very pleased with the quality of the frames. They have just a little bit of springiness[9527] so they can shape to your head if you got a big one like yours truly. I’ve actually noticed a positive effect on my ability to get to sleep already[9527] and it’s only been about a week. My one tiny critique is that the frames have a sort of blueish look to them that kinda look like polarization[9527] but it’s not that big a deal. The picture just is a tad bit misleading.
I've worked on a computer for a living for many years and I can tell it's affected my vision. Blue light from computer screens is supposed to be a contributing factor & I'm thrilled to have a way to block it while I'm working. These are comfortable and look great! My eyes don't seem to feel as fatigued after a long day when I wear these. I love them!
I could feel my eyes relax as soon as I put them on.
  I bought these glasses after my ophthalmologist recommended getting such glasses.  After having a migraine after editing photos online for hours[9527] I bought these glasses.  They really do help.
  Lessens the stress from computer and tv.
I love these glasses and wear the all the time. The reason I’m giving them 4 starts is because the yellow tint is very obvious to others when your wearing them and in pictures.
These glasses are very stylish[9527] lightweight[9527]  and comfortable.  I have noticed my eyes not feeling so strained after a long day of work.
These work great for computer use[9527] and they fit very well.
I tried to adjust the frame for my face but had no success. They were too big to start out with and kept falling off.
The glasses are very cute & they work great[9527] but they have a slight yellow tint to them.
Price and clarity
These glasses are great!!!!!  I can tell the difference when I wear them
Classy old age design. Perfect fitting and size as described in the ad. Fits well and holds tight.
  Used for school
These Blue light blocking glasses are great. They have helped so much with my headaches and eye fatigue.  I am in front of a computer screen all day long. They come in two styles and are a perfect fit.
Excelente
  These are great. Only thing is that it can tend to make it harder when the 50 trying to get your attention on the road.
Bought these for my kids. They live them and it is especially nice how the arms bend out. Definitely worth it!
These glasses are so cute[9527] and effective in blocking the blue light. Great quality and quantity for the price. Both sets of glasses are well made[9527] come well packaged in individual cloth eyeglass bags inside a box[9527] effective in blocking the blue light and best of all they're cute!
These frames are very stylish and fit my face well. I wear them when I'm going to have alot of screen time especially at night[9527] if noticed a difference when wearing them that my eyes aren't as tired anymore! Definitely will be keeping them around.
Stylish and trendy but most importantly help relieve eye strain from working at a computer screen all day.
  Made both of us dizzy and gave us headaches.
I bought this set after a I got tired of dealing with a cheap[9527] flimsy pair from another brand. These are sturdy and they work great! I also think they look nice.
  I work from home and sit in front of two monitors 8hrs a day and the glare from the monitors were killing my eyes. I have these glasses[9527] and my eyes don’t feel as tired. Gave another pair to my daughter the gamer to protect her eyes.
Not worth the cost..<br>I want to return the glasses.
Great valve! I wear them at work and have helped greatly with eye strain / headaches.
Nice look and comfy. Lens are nice and clear.
Great glasses. Affordable and nice looking. Does the job well.
I use these in the evenings to help facilitate better sleep[9527] and they are definitely helping. I’m not used to wearing glasses[9527] so comfort-wise its an adjustment. However they are no less comfortable than my sunglasses. I would recommend these.
Ordered these for my kids due to all the screen time with school.  They seem to like them.  They say they seem to reduce the tiredness in their eyes.  They also say they are quite comfortable and "cute".  I think they are a good product for the money and the kids are wearing them pretty much everything they use a screen.
I was impressed by the packaging of the glasses - very sleek.<br>At work I use a computer on a daily basis and have noticed when I wear the glasses my eyes are less red and sensitive. I am also less prone to headaches when using the glasses. Great and inexpensive purchase for blue light glasses.
Great packaging and they each came with a pouch. They do the job.

Each comes with carrying case that can be used to clean lenses. Great for gift. Helps with vision fatigue and can be used as a stylish accessory.
Eye fatigue and strain is a common occurrence now. These are great to have around. You also get 2 pairs to keep them stashed around the house and office.
I love them! They are so cute and fit my face perfect. I can definitely tell a difference when I don't wear them while I'm working at my computer!
Really pleased with these. I get headaches on days I have to go into the office[9527] and had to look for something to help. They really help with the glare[9527] and I no longer feel so tired at the end of the day as a result. Comfy to wear[9527] and don’t look too bad. I would def recommend!thanks for reading
  We needed to curve the area around the ear a little. But the comfort is great and it reduced strain on the eyes!
I'm on my computer all day for work[9527] and noticed that I've started to get headaches. I'd heard about blue light glasses and how they can help when looking at screens often[9527] so I thought I'd give these a shot. I got the 2 pack so my fiance could use a pair as well. We both love them! No more headaches and they fit comfortably. Awesome product for the price!
Cute[9527] light weight and fashionable
I work as a nurse and love these glasses so far! I used to get headaches often from staring at the computer screen all day and these have stopped those headaches. Love!!!
Love these where both pair all the time now. Helps with my tired eyes and headaches. I work on computers all day 5 days a week. And I'm an avid gamer on the weekends. So blue light has become a regular thing for me. So getting these glasses we live savers.
My eyes are so happy after buying these. After hours of looking at the computer my eyes are no longer strained
I got this two pack for me and my wife. Each pair comes with their own carrying case. As you can see from the picture of my wife - they literally reflect back the blue light of a phone. I've already noticed a difference in my daily headaches on work days after wearing them at my computer. Worth the investment!
These have really cut back on my headaches and they look super cute! I wear them all day everyday and I love them ??
These fit my head[9527] and the lenses are large enough that they don't obstruct my vision. Also they look cute. :)
Use these most days as I'm on a computer quite a bit and feel the strain and irritation on my eyes by the end of the day.  Like the two different styles[9527] and they're durable as well.  Inexpensive so it felt like a better option to try rather than going with a more costly pair without knowing how well they work.  Worth the purchase.
They come in a nice box with a protective bag for each pair of glasses and a blue light tester to know that what you have really works. I bought these for my 9 and 12 year old since they are in front of a screen so much these days. Liked them so much bought another two pairs for me and my husband.
They are great! Highly recommend!
I like the colors and the case and can tell the difference...my eyes don't get tired as easily.
Love!!!
I wanted a product to help protect my eyes as I stare at a computer screen for over eight hours per day. I was so happy with how well-made these glasses were. Very sturdy. I am so happy for the investment. And the box was super cute.
Overall great value for money
I don't like it[9527] it gives off a lot of reflex and causes discomfort.
I was interested in this because i stare at screens alot and they tend to hurt my eyes. When they arrived I did the little test card and was suprized it had worked. I noticed that my saftey glasses were nearby and decided to try the test again. Apparently[9527] my saftey glasses also block blue light. With that note i decided to return them because they most likley were a gimmic of sorts and the little "test" was completly silly[9527] especially if my 2 dollar pair of saftey glasses from Harbor Freight could block the same "dangerous light" as these glasses could. I really wanted them to work and am sad they did not.
The quality of these are great! The packaging was professional and they each have their own little bag to go in so they don't get scratched or honestly you can keep them in the box too. I got them as a last resort to decrease my headaches as I work on the computer from 9-5. I think it's too soon to give a true review in regards to headaches but I CAN say that I have not had a headache yet while wearing them! They were recommended by a friend and she really pulled through it was exactly what I was looking for!
The lenses need constantly clean and I cannot get them fully cleaned off. The frame is a little bit too tight. It is not comfortable to wear.
It's for my granddaughter and she loves it
I strongly recommend this glasses.  They work as advertised...<br><br>J
They are amazingggg! I have been wearing them for a week now and I like them more and more!
They distort my view when looking at computer screen making me sea sick.
Very blurred[9527] a little bit can not see clearly[9527] especially when looking at the computer!
My kids often complain of headaches and their eyes get red a lot. Since we bought these glasses now going on two weeks I haven't seen their eyes look red. Now with all the extra computer time for school work[9527] I wish I would have bought these earlier. So far so good[9527] I actually plan to buy another pair.
Decent price[9527] but a pretty significant glare to the lenses.  it's like I can't quite get them clean. I think they work and the style is nice[9527] but the glare is pretty distracting.  I also had a small scratch in each pair (neither are in the line of sight[9527] so it wasn't worth the effort to return).  I think I should have paid more for higher quality so I didn't have to deal with the glare.
Purchased a set to try and could really tell a difference within the first couple of hours. I don't feel as much eye strain in our office environment and a teammate tried the second pair. Now everyone has one! We need a team pic lol
These are awesome!  I work 8+ hours on a computer and often would come home with headaches and tired eyes.  I’ve been wearing these for the last three days and they are a game changer!  My eyes are no longer tired & the headaches are gone.  And they are super stylish[9527] I’ve gotten compliments when wearing them.  With 2 pairs I can keep one at work and one at home.
Yes' they work great!<br>My eyes said thank you after about 24 hours!
Love these! I bought some glasses for my other son and thought it might be cool to give some to my other son. These are for his birthday in a couple of weeks. These have a nice shape and will look great on him. He spends a lot of time on his computer so I thought these might help him out.
I got these glasses simply because I was looking for some stylish frames. For the price I paid[9527] they're fantastic. The frame feels solid. I don't see these glasses breaking any time soon with everyday usage. Since this is my first time using blue light blocking glasses[9527] I didn't know what to expect[9527] and I like the effect. I stare at computer screen all day and needed help. The difference in how my eyes felt  was noticeable and immediate. They work. Plus[9527] they look cute on my face :) Highly recommend!
These are amazing! They shipped so quickly and I am overall very happy with this purchase :)
I began working at home in Feb. 2020; it was almost immediately evident that I needed to make ergonomic adjustments now being in front of a screen 8+ hours of the day. I love that this came with two colors (tortoise shell and black). I keep one set at my desk and another in my bag for on the go. They come with protective bags as well. These have made such a difference! I am no longer getting head aches and it is easier for me to sleep at night.
I wasted my money[9527] don't buy[9527] cheap things[9527] quality is not good!
They work great! My headaches from screens are almost completely gone.
These do have a yellow tint[9527] though looking at them they look clear. I was really surprised how well they work and how lightweight they are. I now keep one pair at my computer and one with my portable electronics. I notice if I forget to wear them my eyes will get really tired and a little blurry after about an hour. With them I have been able to work at my computer all day without issue.
Long hours at the computer.
  This was my first pair as my Friends and family who also do a lot of work on a computer and gaming like myself recommended I Get some blue light blocking glasses. They do the job but the glare is horrible. I can literally see my eye balls while I’m wearing them. I’ll be going with a differed set with less glare
My only complaint is that the lenses have a yellow tint to it. I have seen some other blue light blocking glasses that don’t have quite an extent of this tint.
They work perfectly!  A little big on my face[9527] but I don't mind.
I work on a computer from school and home every day[9527] and was noticing my eyes feeling strained at the end of each day. The glasses are non prescription but I'm sure you could put your own lenses in if you like the frame. The lenses that they come with have a yellow tint to them if you hit the light correctly[9527] I believe that is the screen light protector film. Really love this eyeglasses[9527] my eyes protects from any bad lights .
They definitely help[9527] but I am really not a fan of the yellow tinted lenses.
These are an eye saver!  Working from home on my computer during COVID and going through my doctorate classes too.  Was noticing my eyes were exhausted come 5pm...with more to do late night.  These cut down on the eye strain immensely.
My favorite thing about these is how sturdy they feel. I have purchased other blue light glasses on Amazon and they have felt cheap and were easy to scratch. I love these because they are light weight but sturdy and come with cases.
Since I have started using these I have not had a migraine! There comfy and cute! Definitely recommend!!
  I like it
I have the black frame( slightly yellow tinted) and the clear frames (clear lens).  Light-weight and build quality is fine. Got them for my sons[9527] since the screen time has gone up. And their eyes seem to bother them more. Figured I'd have them try them out[9527] because the price is right.
Works great to relax your eyes. If you use the computer a lot these are recommended.
I have an addiction to blue light glasses. But they seriously do help with eye strain and headaches if you work in front of a computer all day[9527] which is terrible for your eyes. I keep one pair in my purse and one pair at work.
Not true blue light blocking glasses!
My friend recommended me these glasses[9527] cause i work all day long at the office. It actually helps s lot[9527] my eyes feel less tired and monitor brighter thru glasses. Comes with 2 pairs.
I just brought for my son and girl. Actually[9527] the plastic frame is ok with elastic hinge but i don't know why i feel a lot internal reflection or something else cause some area blurred when i am looking through the lenses.
These blue light blocking glasses are wonderful[9527] and came 2 in the box with each pair having a silk like bag to protect them from scratches.  I kept one pair and gave the other pair to my granddaughter being she is on her tablet quite a bit. She said her pair reduced her eye strain that she had not even realized that her eyes were straining before she tried out her blue light glasses.  I love mine and I can definitely tell a big difference when I am in front of a computer with my glasses on.
  They were too big for my face[9527] they definitely work but we’re not for me!
I can't believe two of these came in one package for the price - they work extremely well and are adorable! I was definitely not expecting this level of quality when I ordered them[9527] I just needed glasses to ease my blue light headaches from staring at my computer screen all day. The headaches are gone and the glasses look great[9527] I'm very happy with my purchase!
Cute and I can tell a difference wearing them!
Didn't realize how much "blue light" strains my eyes until I tried them out. Used at work and even used for gaming.
The glasses are great and have been a lifesaver since we are constantly on screens while working and doing school from home. My only concern is that it gets very dirty very easily. It's almost always oily no matter when we clean them.
These are really nice glasses. Very sturdy yet light as well. They actually appear to be very pricey because they are very nicely made. Two pairs for the price is also OUTSTANDING! ??  ??
  Fits my 12 year old daughter perfect[9527] and also my husband. Love that I got a 2 pack where they both got a pair. The both look at screens for long hours a day
I sit in front of a computer hours at a time for work[9527] and started to notice the strain it was giving me on my eyes. A friend actually recommended this product and they work great and comfortable to wear. Furthermore they just look good too!<br>Keep it up[9527] love the product
Perfect and comfortable
These glasses I have found have a significant glare to the lenses. it's like I can't quite get them clean. I think they work and the style is nice[9527] but the glare is pretty distracting. I think I should have paid more for higher quality so I didn't have to deal with the glare.
The material is not good as I expected[9527] the price is not worth it.
Cute and comfortable. We do a lot of things on the computers and these glasses protect us from blue light. I even make my son use them when he spends time on his tablet
Great
The frames are a bit big for my face and they don't seem as sturdy as another brand I bought but the lenses are the best blue blockers I've ever had.  Really help when I can feel a headache coming on. My eyes are really light sensitive and these help out a lot.
These are great! They help with headaches and eye strain. I ?? Them!
I bought these for my son for Christmas and he loves them. They really look good on him and he has a spare to stay in his car. I may even purchase my husband some to put his prescription lenses inside them
Gave these to a coworker as well- we both love them. They’re cute and they help with my headaches
  Nice
i got this Glasses[9527] 2 Pack Cut UV400 Computer Glasses for Anti Eyestrain[9527] Lightweight they help me  i spend lot of time on office and some time my eyes kind of dry just because the blue light is affecting my eyes and this glasses help me finish my day no pain in my eyes RECOMMENDED !!!!
Really enjoy these glasses[9527] could relly tell the difference when wearing them and since part of my day is in front of a computer or phone im happy to know my eyes are being protected. Two pairs for 20.. What a deal! One for me and one for my child. Great value awesome product and fits our faces well as well as being Oh so stylish.
This is a great pair of glasses really does a good job of blocking blue light and doesnt feel too tight. It looks great and stylish so I would wear them at work if I could. Makes me wish I needed glasses
Love these glasses! Super cute super comfy. I have no more headaches anymore after working a long day on the computer… I really recommend these glasses to anyone who spends a lot of time On screen!
These glasses left me wanting my money refunded. They are like looking through a hazy mirror. I would very much like my money back
Working at a computer screen all day I decided I needed a pair of blue light blocking glasses and these are great.  They look great and save one my headaches.. and you cant beat the price!
Light and comfortable.  Gives any computer screen a warm look removing harsh blue light. Works as advertised.
I’ve been hyping blue light blockers in my family for several months now so that’s what everyone is getting for Christmas ;) This brand is better than some of the others I’ve gotten over time. I love that these are not super tinted like most brands and so they don’t have that obvious glare when you’re wearing them out in public. Blue light blockers help keep my headaches at bay when working all hours on the computer so these are a win for me!
I have been to the eye doctor many times thinking I was going to walk away with glasses because by the end of the day my eyes had difficulty adjusting to small print that normally is no problem. But nope! Great vision. So why was this happening? I am no doctor but staring at my phone[9527] tablet[9527] and computer all day had to contribute. Enter these glasses. After only a few days of wearing them whenever I am in front of the computer or on a mobile device my eyes already can tell the difference. My "tired" eyes are grateful I decided to try these.
This was the second pair of glasses I purchased[9527] after returning my original pair by another brand and am very happy I did so.  These are much more comfortable on my face[9527] feel great and look great.  Also the packaging is just perfectly done.
Glasses for very comfortably. They also are very stylish
  The other one is good and the other one is bad.

High quality in very nicely packaged.
These glasses were super light and fit great but I really couldn't get pass the yellow tint on the lens.  Too bad they couldn't make them a clear lens.
They help with straining on my eyes so much!!!!  the two pack was perfect since i work some days from home and i can keep a pair at work and a pair at home and it has been such a relief to not feel like my eyes are so tired half way through my day.
I am very disappointed[9527] the glasses I bought are not useful at all[9527] even as an ornament[9527] I do not like the style!
I LOVE my blue light glasses!! I have been wearing them anytime I’m using my phone or computer[9527] as well as when reading. They take so much strain off of my eyes[9527] and they are cute to boot! I love the two pack[9527] it gives me a pair for home and a pair for the office. Great buy!
I LOVE these. I wasn’t even looking for anything like this but stumbled across them and thought they were cute[9527] and ordered them. Probably on my top 5 list of best order from amazon. These work so well with screens[9527] especially because I literally stare at a computer all day and sometimes even at night. No dry eyes[9527] tired eyes[9527] or anything! Bonus that they are super trendy looking. I even ordered fakes that aren’t blue light filtering because I love them to much to wear daily.
Comfortable[9527] look good and definitely help!
I wish there is a way of combining the blue light blocking and the ability to use them as reading glasses.
These glasses are perfect. They do have a slight yellow tint[9527] but they are light weight[9527] easy to clean[9527] come with silk cases...I couldn’t be more impressed.
These glasses are not only super stylish but have helped with so many headaches from staring at a screen all day. Great quality and loved that I have two options or can share with someone. They came in draw string bags then a really nice box. It blue light detection card/light.
I am a teacher and like many other teachers are doing[9527] I am teaching from home. Staring at the computer all day was giving me headaches. I got these about a week ago and they have worked perfectly. I haven’t had a headache since. My husband has been sneaking my second pair to wear as well.
I love these glasses! I am constantly on my computer due to the nature of my job and these glasses have relieved eye-strain. Since wearing them[9527] I haven’t gotten a tension headache or migraine. They are very lightweight[9527] modern[9527] and stylish. The package includes a blue light tester and a bag for each pair. I’m very happy with my purchase and plan to buy more!
I like these a lot. I used to get eye strain[9527] headaches[9527]  etc from staring at a computer screen all day. I think they're stylish and protect my eyes and head!
I sit in front of a computer all day and have excellent vision but doing so without the glasses[9527] u was experiencing headaches[9527] blurry eyes by the end of each week... so I have these a try and those two issues went away SO THEY WORK! Woot!
  I'm really impressed with these glasses. I got them because i was starting to feel eye strain and mild headaches by the end of the day. They are pretty sturdy and nice[9527] they definitely do their job and I feel less tired as I work.<br><br>The only reason I'm taking 1 star off is because they're a pain to clean[9527] any little smudge gets magnified and even with the lens cleaning cloth is still not good enough. I have to use glass cleaner to clean them everyday. They also slide off slightly because they're a little too big for my face but that is not a big deal since thy still fit comfortable.<br><br>For the price I say get them[9527] it will make it easier to sit behind a screen all day.
They work
No more headache! No more eye fatigue! I thought these were a gimmick but they are the best. Ordered more as a spare!
Useful and doesn’t give me headaches
I like every aspect of these glasses. I leave one pair at home and have one in my desk at work. I cannot believe the difference it makes for watching tv[9527] being on the computer and dealing with fluorescent lights! My headaches no more!
If you suffer from migraines or have sensitive eyes I wouldn’t purchase these. Im quite sad because I wanted these to work out.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>The frame is absolutely stunning. It has a spring hinge and is top quality. They are even higher quality than some of my designer sunglasses.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>The lenses are a different story. While they do block blue light[9527] they are horribly glary. You cannot wear these in a lit room[9527] the product picks up every source of light and then reflects it. The only way to avoid glare would be to wear them in a dark room[9527] but looking at a screen in a dark room is bad for your eyes anyways. However[9527] the most annoying thing about these is they project two circular blue dots in front of your eyes while wearing these. Seeing this[9527] at least to me[9527] is super bothersome and after taking them off it burned the image in my retinas for a few minutes. Kinda like when you stare at a dot for awhile and then you still see the image after you look away. I could not imagine wearing these for a long time. I got a headache and blurriness after just 5 minutes of wearing (I have sensitive eyes). So I wouldn’t recommend these.<br><br>Nevertheless[9527] to be fair I’ve never owned any blue light glasses so I cannot do a fair comparison. However[9527] I don’t think I’m the only one That this would affect. I will be returning and going to the optometrist to see if real blue light glasses do the same thing.
This was bought as an early Christmas gift and is now past it’s return date - recipient says makes screen too dark for old eyes to see - is it possible to return
Great!
I like the fit of these[9527] they look great[9527] and they definitely block blue light. But both of the pairs I received had scratches on the lenses straight out of the box. Even when I tried to wipe with a microfiber cloth[9527] these marks were there. Kinda disappointed since they were brand new.
I would get headaches every day at work because of my computer screen. Once I used these glasses my headaches stopped. They do tint everything a little bit but I don’t mind. I love the glasses
This is actually 3.5... I had to send them back because one of the glasses had a scratch. The second pair came and the same glasses had a scratch on them! It was less apparent so I've kept them.<br>I really like the springy hinges on the arms[9527] less breakage possibility. Unfortunately they are tinted... So using them to color differentiate can be difficult.<br>Great value for the price tho
My family loves these glasses so much we fight over them[9527] especially now that we’re all distance learners... I may have to order more!
Comfortable and light weight. Maybe a tad large for my face[9527] but still good. More stylish then I thought they’d be and they help with my headaches from the computer screen.
Cute[9527] light[9527] and seem to help!<br>I am totally sold on these babies and I don’t have trouble with headaches but it turns out my eyes hate staring at a screen all day.
I don't wear prescription glasses so these are perfect for me. Light weight and they really help removing the blue from the screen that bothers my eyes. I am glad I purchased them
I like the two different styles to go with multiple outfits or occasions. The packaging comes with a bluelight blocking tester light and card[9527] which is really cool if you ask me. You can test it through the glasses to see that it is actually blocking the blue light. I sit at a computer for a good portion of my day during work[9527] so this is nice to help prevent headaches and eye strain.
  Fashionable and help my eyes
Great help for lots of screen time.
Great product! Are currently being used by my two college-age kids who are on the computer constantly[9527] attending to the myriad of online assignments. Both daughters have been very satisfied with their glasses[9527] thus far.( They arrived about 2 weeks ago.)
I do a lot of work through a screen wether it’s a computer or my phone. I knew there had to be a way to protect my eyes more and thats when I found these. It comes with 2 so I can keep one at home and one at my office. They are very stylish and look great on all face shapes even my husband wears them. They also come with a little device that shows you how effective they are so you know that they are truly protecting your eyes.
Everything about this is above my expectations.  I do IT for a living with many ancillary digital hobbies so I spend a good amount of time in front of screens.  These glasses are the real deal[9527] see my photos which show they actually do what they claim; block blue light!  I have a pretty big head/face and they fit great. I wear a size 7 5/8 baseball cap for reference.  I've been wearing them around the house all afternoon and comfort is not an issue.  Packaging was good[9527]  each pair comes with a soft sleeve lens cloth case.  I got the two pack so I can leave a pair at the office and at home without having to worry about forgetting them which I'm prone to.
Send it fast good price and good quality
Comfortable[9527] lightweight protective glasses. Working on a computer I find these glasses prevent eye strain. So happy I decided to try them. Also very stylish.
Excellent results. I recommend
I work on a computer from home every day[9527] and was noticing my eyes feeling strained at the end of each day. These glasses are comfortable[9527] only have a slight yellow tint compared to other brands[9527] and truly blocks blue light! They include a blue light testing kit so you can see it working for yourself. I have the tortoise shell[9527] and my husband is wearing the black!
I liked the fit and the comfort.
There ok
  Comes in a great package with two cloth cleaning cases. One of the pairs came scratched but the seller replied quickly and rushed a new package overnight. Great product and service.
These are helpful and trendy. They are large enough that you can fit them over prescription glasses for the added benefit. Great product!
  Show no noticeable change in screen
I have a couple of these already[9527] so I thought they’d be good gifts for my sister and brother in law. They typically don’t wear glasses[9527] so not only did these help with them looking at their phones and computer screens[9527] they are also flattering! Super cute and stylish! Highly recommend anyone to get these[9527] as it comes in a pair!
Great blue light blocking glasses! The lenses have a yellow tint and I can tell that the TV and computers don't give off that blue tint when I'm using the glasses. I'm hoping these glasses will reduce headaches from being on the computer all day! They are also very stylish!
These are super cute and comfortable! I can already tell a difference in my headaches being reduced by using them when I spend hours at the computer for work!
My headaches have gone way down! I used to get them all the time staring at the screen but these have totally helped.
Helps so much with eye strain & tired eyes ! Lightweight & comfortable !
Great for reading and gaming.
Very lightweight[9527] Seem to be durable. I like how they came with blue light tester.
The quality is terrible[9527] I have to return the project and waste my money!
They are great right before bed when your on technology. Better sleeping quality- I noticed a difference in a day.
I have been using these for over a week and have notice a some improvement with my eye strain especially at night when I'm on my computer and phone. These are some very comfortable and light weight glasses.  The frame comes with spring loaded hinges that are comfortable and expand for wider face like mine. The glass is tinted with a special film and is not just a yellow lens like those other stylist eye wear.
Got these to use when working from home on a computer all day and they really make a difference. Used to get headaches after sitting at a computer for 10 hours a day but with these I haven’t gotten one yet. Have been using them for about two months and they’re very durable and are definitely worth the money especially if you work on a computer a lot
  I recently purchased these glasses for my desk job and school.  The glasses are so comfy and seem very well made!  Though certain research studies say blue light glasses don't work[9527] my eyes feel much better.  The only thing I would change about these glasses is to put anti-slip material along the sides so the glasses don't slide down often.  Other than that[9527] I definitely recommend!
I purchased these when we transitioned to working remotely. I had a day with several online meetings and my eyes were killing me. The blue blocking seems to help nicely when I’m consistent about wearing them. The lenses scratch super easily though. I am careful with them[9527] but they are noticeably scratched to the point they almost look dirty. Luckily there were 2 in the pack and the price was good!
These are a game changer. Started wearing these when I had to work from home. In days when I didn’t wear them[9527] but was on my computer all day- I had a headache by the end of the day because of eye strain. These are perfect for those who are on their computer all day and need blue light blockers.
These are exactly what I was looking for! Working 10-12 hours on my computer and cell phone every day was taking a toll on my eyes! I don’t wear prescription glasses but I saw a few bloggers posting about these blue - light glasses and our doctor so I bought these! So happy I did!!  Comes two pairs[9527] comfortable and don’t look ridiculous! Helps my eyes and overall super happy with my purchase[9527]
They work great... less eye strain from computer and cell screens.
These blue light glasses take the strain of the computer light away. They are great and are very comfortable!
My whole family has an array of blue light glasses -- these are way more yellowish tinted (coated) and heavily reflective. Debating returning -- style and fit are nice though.
I am always on my computer so I know what my eyes feel like when they are too sore. This helps by cutting back on some of the blue light that is problematic. It helps a bit but if you are really desperate to get the orange ones as they cut all blue light. This set comes with 2 pairs[9527] and a UV blue light tester to show how the lenses block a lot of the light. works pretty good and I'm even wearing them to write this review.
My son wanted these glasses because he spends lots of time in front of a computer with his job and plays video games to relax after work. They are stylish and provide a clear view of the screen. He’s worn them about 2 weeks now and says his eyes feel less fatigued then without them so he is going to continue to use them. 2 pairs of glasses come in the box also which is nice.
Like them very much
I like these they get the job done. My headaches from looking at my work computer is not as bad. For the price they are a Quality product. I’d buy it again.
These have been a head saver!  I typically get migraines and since wearing these haven’t even even gotten a slight headache.
They did the job. Yellow tint is not overly noticeable. Shape is good[9527] but a little too large. Overall the frames are just too heavy. I wanted to love these and was looking forward to no nose pieces[9527] but the weight was just too much. It put more strain on my nose/face than the eye strain was that I was trying to help.
I LOVE THESE! So cute and stylish and they really help with eyestrain. I have several pairs of these but these are by far my favorite. I keep one pair at work and another at home.
These are great! Looking at a pair of monitors all days gave me some eye fatigue[9527] but these glasses are great for reducing that.
Very useful! Does as advertised[9527] very slightly cheap feeling but I take good care of them so it’s not a huge con[9527] they are also a little too tight on the sides of my head but I have a big head so...
These glasses arnt the best for small faces[9527] other then that they are great
Really good quality and cute style. I noticed a big difference in lack of eye strain when working on my computer.
Just as described. Great glasses
I started a cubicle office job after college[9527] and I was not used to staring at a computer all day. I was studying old scanned engineering drawings[9527] and I could tell I was getting too close to the screen[9527] and I leaving work everyday with headaches. These are actually the second pair of blue light blocking glasses that I've ordered[9527] and I can tell that they drastically reduce my headaches. I like the aesthetics of these[9527] and they don't look like yellow lenses when someone is looking at you. The lenses are plastic though[9527] so you'll have to work harder at keeping them smudge free than you do with a glass lens. I'm just so happy with the results of these that I plan to keep them well taken care of from the get go!
I spend most the day working from home on my phone and computer and these glasses have helped me tremendously! The protection they give my eyes is awesome and they are super cute and trendy! They are comfortable and lightweight[9527] perfect glasses!
I work in an office and used to get multiple ocular migraines a week. I wear these every day[9527] any time I’m using a computer[9527] and I have not gotten an ocular migraines in weeks.
It looks nice and it comes in a nice box.<br>It's helping keeping my eyes healthy and it also helps me sleep.
Son's mother raves about these.  She uses them at her job where she is on a computer all day
I was afraid these would be too "cheap" at first[9527] but they really do the job!  Light weight[9527] not the most sturdy[9527] but super comfortable and helps get through long days in front of a monitor. I use these when gaming for hours on end and have experienced fewer headaches and eye strain.  My wife uses these for working 8 hour days on the computer[9527] and feels more focused and less eye strain at the end of the day. Such a great deal!
If you sit at a computer all day these work great to help with the glare.  No headaches or straining.  I don't know what took me so long to buy these.
Awesome glasses. Do what they say for sure. Giving 4 stars because the plastic is a bit cheap feeling and also the glasses get dirty/smudgy SO much quicker than normal glasses. These are a good option if you’re looking for blue light glasses that are effective but won’t break the bank.
These glasses showed on advertising pictures look cool[9527] in fact[9527] is not[9527] the glasses frame is very hard [9527]my head a little big[9527] wear up feel very tight [9527] very hard very uncomfortable[9527] and the frame looks poor quality[9527] and[9527] after a few days with the test[9527] did not feel any good[9527] like only wearing  a piece of glass[9527] line of sight is not very clear[9527] not good[9527] return!
Good for working on the computer all day or playing video games
I wanted an effective pair of blue light glasses to prevent eye strain[9527] and I also wanted a pair that looked good. But.. I didn't want to spend too much on a pair of nonprescription glasses. Can I have all three?? YES! Looks good[9527] works well[9527] great price.. winner! I gave my husband the extra pair[9527] and now he uses them daily as well. We honestly didn't expect them to make as significant as a difference as they did. My classes have been switched to full time online and some days my eyes are so dry and feel like they're about to burst[9527] before I remember my glasses. They ease my eyes tremendously. Highly recommend!
You can hold them out in regular lighting and see that the lenses are actually blue blocking protectant. A very universal fit[9527] they fit men and women and the color variety is a plus! Overall recommending to everyone!
This product is cute but I get a reflection and it is hard to see out of
I use these for work and keep one in my purse just in case. They are wayyyy to big for my face and the lens dirty easily. Beware if you use these on the daily and then stop you will strain your eyes. For the price it’s good I guess. After so many use they just become wobbly.
I am so glad I purchased these. I recently started back at a desk job and have to stare at a computer screen all day. These really make a difference and I find my eyes feeling less tired after using them. It is a two pack so you get black and brown frames. The glasses fit very comfortably[9527] not too big for my face.
Does the trick
Love these! I have blue light prescription glasses but I always wear my contacts so these glasses are perfect with no prescription. I have noticed such a difference when staring at my computer for long periods of time and I get no more headaches!
Nice pair of glasses but could be a little strongero
I love these glasses! I use one pair for gaming and the other for work since I sit at a computer all day. Definitely a defference! I also like that they give you a blue light tester which shows you just how much blue light these glasses cancel out! So worth it!
I saw an add for blue light glasses on a flight and decided to give them a try[9527] these glasses are the perfect size and have noticeably improved the eye strain from staring at screens. I also wore them on the drive to work in the morning and it helped dull other drivers headlights which was an added perk
The glasses are comfortable and stylish.
These glasses are very fashionable and trendy. Price is awesome and my eyes doesn’t hurt anymore when I use them.
I bought another pair of blue light blockers that my daughter hijacked recently so I bought this two-pack for me and to have a spare if she swipes another one too. I love the tortoise shell and the frames look good on my face! I hate the idea of damaging my eyes doing something so “everyday”. There is a noticeable difference when wearing them!
Great glasses. I use my computer for school all day and these really help to protect my eyes from hurting.
These glasses are great. Lightweight[9527] cute and actually work. I was about to spend $60 on one brand name pair but decided to try these first. Glad I did. Much less money for two pairs[9527] and my vision no longer gets blurry while working on the computer for 8 hours straight. You can notice the difference right away. Really glad I gave these a shot before splurging on another pair.
Not only are these cute and comfortable[9527] they are so necessary. Since I started my digital job[9527] I have been having so much headaches looking at the computer screen all day. I instantly noticed a difference when wearing these. Definetely a must have.
Not sure what they are supposed to do as a friend told me to buy them. But they work as I’m able to fall asleep after being in my devices all night.
Muy buenos para usar en la computadora
Comfortable and always useful for nightshift. It really makes a difference in my headaches and eye strain on shift. Nightshift nurses need these.
I have been looking for some blue light blocking glasses. I work on my computer doing designs many hours a day and have started getting headaches. I don’t have bad vision so my doctor suggested these. I am so impressed with the presentation of them. They are very nicely packaged and come in a box and then in protective bags. They are so cute (love the brown printed ones) and light weight. I am honestly so shocked at how much blue light is actually blocked. My husband is using the other pair for reading on his phone so this was a 2 for 1 kinda deal for us! Highly recommend.
Super cute and helps a lot since I’m using a computer all day.
Look and work as expected[9527] however quickly noticed how cheaply made they are. The black glasses have already broken (screw was half in[9527] sideways when arrived). Can't complain as you get what you pay for. They are fine and do the trick if you're looking for a cheap pair of blue light glasses.
The blue light glasses actually work! I’ve been using for 2 weeks and I definitely notice that my eyes don’t feel strained at the end of a long day looking at my screen. Good purchase for 2 glasses.
Being home during quarantine and staring at a computer to work[9527] play and socialize was killing my eyes. I was losing the ability to concentrate because my eyes were getting so uncomfortable.  I decided to try out some blue light blocker glasses.  These come neatly packaged and feel high quality.  They sit comfortably on my face and actually look really cute. I did notice that I could work longer without my eyes getting tired while wearing these so I guess they work.  The even send you a cool blue light so you can see the glasses at work!
  Quality for a great price
This product has been great for me as I work on a computer for most of my day.  It was a great value and would recommend for anyone who gets headaches while sitting in front of the computer for long periods of time.
do not recommend
My laptop screen can only get so dim so i wanted to use these for nighttime computer use when the lights are off. They turn everything a slight tinge of yellow but it's not a drastic color change. The lenses reflect a narrow range of blue light which helps my headaches that i get when using my gadgets at night. The frames feel like good material and they look stylish as well.
Amazing! I didn’t realize how much the blue light really does bother me! I am so impressed with how these changes my ability to stay on my computer working longer. Good quality and definitely a necessary item. I now understand why these were created. I have a pair at home and a pair at work!
I ordered these for my daughter. She was having issues with the fluorescent lighting at school so I thought these would do the trick. That was before concussion number 3! These glasses have really helped her with not only the lighting but have been invaluable with her concussion issues.
Nice[9527] comfort[9527] very light and beautiful design!
Glad I ordered these.
I’m 6’4” with a large head and these glasses were way too small. The lens size and height was fine but the frames weren’t wide enough for my head. Advice to anyone with a big head look for wider frame. Having said that I can’t give them a poor review because I have a big head and didn’t do enough research into the width of these frames. the glasses seemed fine and definitely filtered blue light.  I ended up giving them to my wife who loves them! Will be looking elsewhere for larger frames[9527] but to anyone with a normal sized head these are great glasses.
  It’s comfortable
Bought one for me and my friend who sits in front of a computer a lot. These have been very helpful since I work a lot in front of a computer and use a computer a lot for school. My friend likes the gift a lot.
These are awesome... less stress while working online
I purchased these because I was getting headaches at the end of the day after being on the computer all day[9527] and specifically because this was a two-pair deal.  I keep a pair at work now and use them throughout the day when my eyes feel tired or I have a headache coming on.  Plus[9527] they make me look intelligent ??????.
Gave one of these to my wife and I use the other pair. Works well especially with multiple monitor. Helps me not strain my eyes as fast. Not bad looking set of glasses either. You can't even tell they are for blue light
  These are amazing! Love them for work[9527] super cute[9527] comfy and they help my eyes so much!!!
Son geniales[9527] las recibí en perfecto estado[9527] vienen en un estuche muy elegante y todo bien organizado[9527] las uso para trabajar y para en la noche jugar en mi ordenador[9527] estoy muy satisfecho con la compra!
We both spend a good amount of time looking at screens. He does IT work so  atleast 5 days a week then also more time when off work. He doesn't need glasses[9527] but has discussed tired eyes and eye dr recommended something like this being beneficial among other things. His eyes tend to get very bloodshot from it all[9527] feel strained[9527] tired and itchy. Not to mention headaches. I wear glasses myself. At first it was worst and most noticeable when going grocery shopping. Maybe the different lighting? Now I have to wear them most of the time. I've noticed there are times where if I'm looking at my phone[9527] tablet[9527] or laptop and focused in on it too long then glance up at the tv things can appear pretty blurry for me and it's an adjustment switching from looking at one thing to the other. I figured this 2pk would allow each of us to give these a try. He took the black ones and myself the tortoiseshell ones. We really lucked out as I think they look great on both of us. The lenses have a slight yellow tone to them. They even came with a nice soft case and a blue light. They are lightweight and comfortable. We both agree they have helped and made a difference. Good price.
I love these they prevent eye strain for either doing homework or gaming. One pair for me and one for my girlfriend “we both look great”.
I bought these for my daughter and myself to use when we are on the computer and gaming. We are huge gaming family but my daughter and I have epilepsy. These have helped us tremendously.
I absolutely love these glasses. I purchased them to wear while i was browsing on my phone. They did so well i decided to take a pair to work to use while on the computer. They have totally exceeded my expectations and really do block out the blue light and help with eye strain. I have had noticeably less headaches at work since wearing them and find it easier to go to sleep at night after browsing on my phone. I highly recommend these!
The black pair came with small scratch and I have now been using them for a week and they seem to smudge very easily. I am having to wipe the lens often.
  A little bit tight on the face. The glass is pretty yellowed and has a lot of glare .
  Product is fine. I have to wear the leopard pair and as a rugged dude I wouldn’t be caught dead in them[9527] but they are wide enough and seem to work well. I’m more tired after taking my melatonin so there is a good chance they are working. The black pair has a inconsistency in the left lens so they make my eyes hurt and are pretty much unwearable. All in all though[9527] I can’t complain too much because they came as a two pack for cheaper than almost all the other singles. Does what I need at the end of the day.
They came quickly and I love them. I love the come with packages to store them in and I love the box they came in very nice product
These glasses are great!! I’ve received multiple compliments on how they look and they appear to alleviate the stress on my eyes after only a few days of use.
Bought these for my kids and are great! Highly recommend!
Has a nice box and bag to keep the glasses in.
  Nice glasses[9527] very sleek and sharp. I got the 00 rx[9527] so no magnification. The blue-light blocking is very good and I could feel it immediately when I put them on. However[9527] the glare that comes off these glasses is unreal. I sit in front of an open window and I can see the light on the lenses while wearing them and it's very distracting. I wish there was a way to get rid of the glare. It is pretty disappointing. But[9527] if you are in an office[9527] and perhaps only have over-head lights you might be okay. I love the natural light from my window. Also[9527] the yellowing of the lenses is very visible on your face which is NOT visible in the photos at all. But that's what you get with blue-light blocking lenses.
I wanted something to protect my eyes from blue light because i stare at computer screen for 40+ hours a week and my eyes usually hurt a lot. My friend suggested to get these glasses and these have been helpful since i wear them. I'm recommending these to my colleagues as well and they are going to try them for eye relief.
  Great value arrived quickly
I didn’t receive the product. I received everything else except the adult glasses
  They are very lightweight and comfortable.  A little too small for my big head but they fit my wife and kids well.  The test card and light they sent with it is cool too. Really shows how effective they are at blocking the harmful light.
Love the flex of the arms[9527] and the lens work perfectly. Even better is i received two!
Loved the style and they work
Work great
These glasses actually work well and feel quite sturdy. I had expected them to be somewhat cheap so I was pleasantly surprised by how well they are made. It has also proved to be a sneaky way to get my boyfriend[9527] who had lasik years ago[9527] to look like a sexy Clark Kent.
These work great for blue light and help my headaches a ton. I’m on a computer all day and these really help. They have a slight yellowish tint on lenses so not the most stylish but looks great nonetheless.
  They are too big for my face. I compared the measurements to a pair I already have[9527] and they were even bigger than what the measurements said.
These are great. Sadly my 4 year old scratched a pair within 2 days of my getting them but I guess that’s why there’s 2 pairs.
For this price everybody should have them!<br>You can feel a difference for your eyes immediately.
Perfect find. Well made glasses and have helped with my headaches from looking at the computer 10-13 hours a day for work and school. I would highly recommend!
Headaches gone from the computer screen on the first day of use! AMAZING!
It's good.
These are by far my FAVORITE blue blocking glasses. They come 2 to the pack and are in individual protective bags. The black and tortoise colors are very stylish.<br>They are light[9527] extremely comfortable[9527] and they would look good on everybody.<br>They have reduced my eye strain so much.<br>I have had less headaches since wearing the glasses.<br>I definitely recommend to those who spend any time in front of a television or computer screen.
They filter the blue light as far as I know however[9527] my vision is extremely blurry after I take them off and I’m a little scared of my vision being messed up because of these. Blurry vision was not occurring before I began wearing these glasses and it only happens after I wear them. Glad they were only $20 and I didn’t waste a ton of money on them
I’m an IT professional that has a lot of daily required screen time and off for personal.  The eye fatigue is reduced with these glasses.  I am bey happy that I purchased them keep one at work and the other at home.  A great product if you hav a lot of screen time.  Good value price and they look good too.
It's snake oil[9527] not enough blue light is admitted from monitors to cause any issues. Tested it with the blue light and light strip the glasses came with by putting it up to the screen for 3 hours.
Lightweight and comfortable to wear. It comes with a small blue light to be able to test the lenses. I believe it’s worked on my eye exhaustion and headaches.
I like that I have 2 pair in different colors.<br>Glasses very comfortable[9527] lightweight[9527] stylish[9527] and help with working in front of computer screen for the whole day. I can tell the screens aren’t as bright when I’m wearing them. My coworkers tried them on and really like them.
Relief for tired eyes on screens all day for work and life. Shared the 2nd pair with my daughter[9527] a college student. I recommend.
Good stuff
love it perfect
Great product!!! They really work
I like my glasses and really enjoy watching the tv and computer!
Good glasses[9527] work well
Geneales incluso para manejar de noche
Great
Great product for the extra screen time during quarantine.
These work as they are supposed to and I get less headaches[9527] unless I wear them for a while.  I have small ears and though these are light weight[9527] the pressure on my ear causes headaches...wish there was a bit of cushioning instead of just the plastic.  Overall satisfied!
It's very good. I was worried that it will not fit me[9527] since a regular sunglasses are always hard to find for me. These are very good and stylish. They are comfortable to wear and my eyes are not dry after 8 hours shift. I'm glad I got these.
Great product[9527] loved the packaging. My only concern is that 1 of my 2 glasses were defective. Using the blue light tester[9527] I quickly realized that one of my lenses was backwards. The blue light tester was strong on the left lens[9527] but the right lens was weaker[9527] with the stronger blocking side on the inside of the glasses. Other than this production error[9527] I think it's great product[9527] most likely a rare mixup.
I use this product for work in front of a computer all day and my husband uses them for gaming.  They are really comfortable and lightweight and helpful.  I try to remember to use them every day and when I forget I notice a headache coming on or just really tired eyes in the evenings.
I had to wear this for several days before I can make an honest review. I was skeptical because how can a glasses help me not to strained my eyes. I’m always getting headache while or after reading from my laptop or computer. So I searched from amazon and found these. Comes with 2 pair of glasses and the price was excellent. So I bought them.  They works. I don’t have pain or headache after reading from my laptop.
Ordered for my teen daughter. She loves them. Her eyes are much less tired.
Great glasses and takes away most all eye strain[9527] definitely get better sleep after using these glasses
Very nice product.  Recommended
Don’t know how I survived without these. I’ve been getting headaches from staring at a computer screen all work day and then my phone thereafter. Since purchasing these glasses I wear them during my work day and no longer get headaches. They warm the appearance of colors which is gentle on the eyes. I also happen to think the glasses look cute. The product comes with two pairs. I have my boyfriend the other and he loves them too.
They really work[9527] love them. Only complaint is that u can tell they r tinted[9527] but not a huge deal.
Love these glasses.  They slide a little down the bridge of your nose so they sit on my cheeks but I really love them.  I keep one pair at work and one at home[9527] so it's perfect.  And for the price I'm thrilled!  I do feel a difference when using them which is what matters most.
I use one pair for work and my bro who works in cyber security said this helps him a lot because he use to get a lot of headaches before using these glasses.
High quality[9527] lightweight[9527] does what it claims. Wore them the last few nights while watching tv and with my tablet in hand. It made a significant improvement in my sleep.  We are ordering these for all our adult children this Christmas.
I stare at a computer screen all day long.  Usually[9527] when I get home in the evenings[9527] I just want to close my eyes because they just feel tired.  Since I started wearing these glasses at work[9527] I don't have that issue any more!  Plus[9527] they look so super cute!  Love that it comes with two pair so I can change up my look when I want.
I own about 5 pairs of blue blocking glasses. These are a perfect set!! They aren’t right around my head or ears. They work great for being on a computer[9527] tablet[9527] or phone for long periods of time. You can never have too many blue blocking glasses.
They were too wide and had an odd glare. I returned them.
i like them
I ordered one pair of this blue light blocking glasses and I have been using them at work for nearly one week now. I love this blue light blocking glasses because my eyes are not strained and tired anymore when i use these glasses
I have been using these for a few weeks now when I am at work since I am starting at 3 screens all day long. My eyes were always so tired at the end of the day and dry. Since using these my eyes are no longer tired or dry. Since it comes in 2 pair I keep 1 at work and 1 in my home office. The difference since I started using them has been awesome. They took a few days to get adjusted to since I would catch something out if the corner of my eye[9527] but BYE BYE florescent lighting and blue lights.
These glasses are sleek and stylish. They are comfortable to wear and fit my wider face well. It really has made a difference with me getting headaches[9527] I have gotten fewer since using this product at work. Thanks
I’ve worn it for a couple of months now. It helps tone down the amount of light that the office emits from the computer screen to the office lights. I notice my eyes area lot less tired and I can slave away a lot longer.<br><br>A lot of people do notice the amount of blue it shows when I wear them. Which seems to be more than what people with prescription glasses have.<br><br>I also enjoy wearing them outdoors as it avoids the bugs hitting my eyes as well.<br><br>I would suggest to be careful driving at night with these. They emit a lot of blue glare.
Cool.
The glasses look nice and are comfortable. They are also very effective and help sleep better.
I loved the idea of these glasses[9527] but am only half satisfied. The black glasses are holding up wonderfully but the brown ones the lenses only after two times using them the blue tint is what looks like is rubbing away. Not that happy.
Bought as a gift for my roommate who recently transitioned to working remote. They were constantly getting headaches from looking at their screen. They wear the glasses whenever they use their computer now even if just surfing the web and believe that they are helping with limiting the headaches they were receiving throughout the day.<br><br>Pros: Stylish[9527] Lightweight and the packaging is top notch.
I was just diagnosed with a concussion and my clinician recommended these. They didn’t provide any value in me being able to look at my electronics[9527] so back they went.
I stare at a computer screen All day and these glasses helped more then any other blue blocking ones I’ve had before.
I'm very satisfied with the glasses I used every time and it helped me with my headaches and with the red eyes.<br><br>100% recommend
  I wanted to find a sturdier pair of blockers because the ones I had before were essentially just plastic crap[9527] and they smudged and scratched super easily. These came quickly[9527] and when I pulled out the first pair[9527] I found one tiny scratch outside my line of vision. A little disappointed[9527] but totally wearable and not noticeable unless I take them off and point it out. These are stretchy and definitely one size fits most. They feel sturdy[9527] and they look nice. My other pair was unscathed. Over all[9527] I do enjoy them[9527] I just wish that little scratch wasn't there.
No[9527] I don't like this style. It's different from the picture.
  Very sturdy and reasonably lightweight. They slide down the nose quite easily and create minor pain/pressure points on the side of my head.
  Got these after my move to Japan was causing an increase in my migraines. Not sure if it’s the crazy bright sun here or the amount of time spent on electronics. Even with the dark mode and blue light disable on electronics[9527] they still seem to cause spots in my vision and then soon a migraine hits. Hoping these help!<br>When I put them on I immediately felt some relief. I was able to open my blinds and didn’t experience any painful side affects like I did before them. Fingers crossed!<br><br>Either way— they definitely do what they are sold for. Highly recommend.
I’ve been wanting some blue light glasses for a while now[9527] and I’m so glad I found these! My eyes feel less tired after a day of working on the computer when I wear these. They’re lightweight and comfy. And super cute!
Very clear and makes me feel better as I expect.
  Use them for gaming[9527] hardly realize I still have them on once I'm done playing.
They're sturdy[9527] came well packaged with individual sleeves for storage/protection - all in all a good purchase.
I liked the packaging and the glasses are super cute and lightweight.
I do a lot of work on the computer and have been getting headaches. I thought I would buy these glasses to see if there is an improvement. Definitely makes the screen look a lot clearer. I love these glasses! And they are cute too!
The quality of the glasses isn't good at all.I won't buy it anymore.
These have helped immensely... and I’ve gotten numerous compliments!!!
They were just way too small[9527] can’t wear them long
I’m a college student and due to covid[9527] I had to be on my game on work and turning assignments in. I was a little nervous[9527] but I bought these after weeks of sitting on my computer. My eyes would be so tired out from staring at the screen for hours on end and these really do make all the difference. In my experience[9527] after taking them off my face and looking at the screen[9527] the screen seemed so intense. I was missing out on these. They’re not expensive and you get a deal of 2 that are great. I got the clear and back ones. The black ones have more of a yellowish tint on the lens but I don’t mind it and you can’t tell looking at me. I use the clear ones when I’m on my phone or just to switch things up a bit but I love them. So happy with them!
Where have these been all my adult life?! These actually work!! I never knew glasses like this existed until I was introduced to these! My headaches from my computer screen are GONE! Yoy know that annoying pinch at the bridge of my nose from reader glasses? Not with these!!!!
Son súper cool. Buen material[9527] ligeros y desde que los uso descanso mucho la visión.
So cute and stylish! I wear this everyday at work[9527] while in front of my computer
  He likes them
These will absolutely save my eyes. I stare at screens for my job and overall will spend 12+ hours looking at a screen during a normal day (including home time[9527] tv[9527] etc) and I easily used these for all of the blue light sources. I’ve noticed a change to harshness on my eyes when I remove them[9527] and they’re VERY comfortable. I love the look of the tortoise frame and my husband chose the black.
  The glasses are very comfortable[9527] and my eyes don’t get tired anymore. Plus they are two pairs of glasses for this price. You can’t beat this deal. Great product.
I feel like these glasses are ok. They are flimsy and feel like they could break at any point. They are also not as clear (they have a weird glare) compared others at around this same price point.
Work well! Good product[9527] arrived as expected.
Feel good and look nice.
Perfect for the amount of time we play on our phone.
You can see through them
I received it yesterday however decided to return it. I feel the frames are pretty fragile. When I wore it[9527] I feel very dizzy right away. The glasses are a bit blurry[9527] it is not clear.
These are the only blue light glasses that have ACTUALLY worked really well for me. I HATE that they have a yellowish tinge to them[9527] it looks odd[9527] especially when on video. However[9527] there are the best actual “blue light blocking glasses” out there. I’ve tried several[9527] and these give the most relief from straining my eyes on a screen.
I ordered these after borrowing a pair of my sister in laws. They are amazing. I suffer from migraines and staring at a computer screen for hours a day doesn’t help but these glasses have helped me so much!!
  It blocks blue light ok[9527] but you can see glare from behind you on the lenses[9527] which is really distracting.
The blue light blocking glasses by Madeyes came in a nicely packaged box that opens easily to reveal 2 pairs of glasses stored in a silk like sleeve. The box is perfect for gift giving or storage.<br>The frames are just what I was looking for. The frames are very trendy and perfect for my style.<br>The glasses themselves have been a huge help for staring at a computer screen for 8+ hours a day. I have noticed a decrease in headaches.
Fit great and look great
Very stylish[9527] great packaging[9527] unfortunately the lenses were not very clear. It was not as bad as looking through a glass coke bottle[9527] but it was the same effect. Not sure if it was a fluke pair[9527] but I have another brand now and they do not have the same issue.
Hurts eyes to wear.
Work great. My son’s eyes are not hurting like they were while playing games.
great deal!
When wearing my contacts I was noticing more and more my eyes being tired after computer use.  My prescription lens have coating already for eye strain.  So I picked up this set in order to have one in my desk and one at home.<br><br>I’ve noticed my eyes are less tired after a day doing computer work.  So I think they are doing as described.
  Very good buy for the price. Well made.
I really likes how these glasses weren't completely yellow tinted on the lens. You can see a comparison beside a pair of glasses that has a very deep yellow tint[9527] which can be really off-putting when wearing them in the office. The glasses are honestly pretty stylish and don't stand out as being blue light blocking glasses.<br>Overall I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend these.
I am sending back. They make everything yellow and have blue glare on outside lens. Plus they were to big for my face.
  Use this for games or long editing sessions[9527] literal life safer.
Got these because I look at a screen 8 hours a day for work. I would go home with headaches and feel very sleepy. Got these to help alleviate some eye strain. These make a noticeable difference. You can see a big difference in the screen after only wearing them for seconds.
I work at a computer between 8-12 hours a day. I was getting frequent headaches and decided to give these blue blockers a shot. They work great and they’re super light so you barely feel them. Headaches are gone. Also[9527] I’m sure they look fashionable and good on some people. I look like a mixture of Clark Kent and Shrek if you took Clark Kent out of the equation and put glasses on Shrek.
These glasses are very sleek and quality feeling... my only quarrel was the slight tent/discoloration that they give off. I guess I sort of expected the lenses to be more optically "clear" or translucent. Also[9527] note that if you plan on wearing these during a zoom or web meeting.... DONT. They reflect the light super distractingly off of my computer monitors. It looked super silly so I just took them off during my multiple rounds of back to back zoom meetings.
Diffently recommend for people who use a computers for daily work or more then 3 hours a day.
This kind of glasses are look good[9527] but when I wear up it is not comfortable. Feel head dizzy[9527] And not suitable for me
I like them.  Looks nice
The glasses are very stylish[9527] simple but sleek. I have a relatively large head and they fit better than any other pair I've tried. Frames are very flexible which helps. Excellent blue light blocking ability. First day with them and it's already helping my eyes. And you get 2 pairs which is really convenient. My only complaint is they smudge and pick up dust/dirt really easily so you have to clean frequently.
Super comfortable to wear. I am on my laptop[9527] desktop and cell several hours a day. They glasses have helped tremedouly. I have a pair on my night stand and at my desk. Headaches have eased and tired eyes are no longer. Great quality[9527] I recommend. Also Cute.
Glasses themselves are well made[9527] but one of the screws was loosen when I received them. And one arm fell out when I tried to tighten the screw. Kind of disappointed[9527] should’ve check before shopping them out to customer.
Made a huge difference at work
Good quality and everything g is awesome with these ! The only thing would be that when the sun shines on them I get a really bad glare
I got them for my heavy computer work at the office.  I helps a lot[9527] I should have got them long ago
It’s very helpful to my eyes especially working and staring at computer screen almost all day at work. My eyes stop straining because of this glasses. Before I use this light blocking glasses[9527] I always get headache after work[9527] but now it’s fine. It very very helpful for me daily.
Feel comfortable to wearing it!
They made a major difference working on my computer for many hours in a day!
however the longer i wear it the more dizzy i get.just doesn't make any sense if i wear it on working in front of the computer whole day.
Light weight and after a week of use[9527] felt less eye strain and burning of my eyes
They're great. Post lasik I was having headaches in the office with fluorescent lights. Since wearing these to work[9527] zero headaches. The only bummer is that I couldn't get two black pairs in a pack.
Satisfied with the quality of the product.
I've had these for approx. two months now[9527] and while the blue light block is effective[9527] I struggle with the size. My head is medium-large in size and I feel like they are always sliding down my nose.
It's easier to be in front of a computer screen for longer periods of time. I also noticed that these help with night driving. I may sound like an old person[9527] but wearing contacts and headlights at night don't mix well. These definitely help with that. Glad I got these.
  Amazing !! We bought them bc we are in front of our phones and laptops a lot and my sons started to complain that their eyes were hurting. They truly do make a difference and fit both my husband and I and our sons. Definitely one size fits all. They are comfortable and light weight and come with a satin carrying case that has a draw string. I wear them most of the day and my eyes don’t feel as strained anymore !
  Product was really good. I am enjoying it. So far my sight feels better. The built feels a little flimsy[9527] but nothing to worry about. I would recommend this[9527] specially for the price.
These glasses are comfortable and my eyes definitely have not been as easily strained while working on my computer when wearing them. However[9527] they are extremely reflective which causes a lot of back-glare when looking through them in almost all types of lighting. This is a bit distracting and annoying.
I bought these glasses for me and my wife because we are at home working from home and these glasses helps us minimize the exposure to IPAD/Laptop.
These do cut out the blue light from the computer... they are super cute[9527] 2 pairs very stylish!! The packaging is amazing as well.  There is a blue light tester that comes with these as well.
Not only do these work amazing blocking the blue light[9527] they are so stinking cute!! I get so many complements daily. Amazing quality for the price. You can tell the difference so intensely it’s almost weird thinking about how you once didn’t use them while staring at a computer all day. I would absolutely recommend these to anybody interested. I wear one pair and my daughter wears the other.
These are great glasses.  Super fast shipping.  Gave my husband one pair and kept one. I love that they give you a little UV light with the tester card.  It's so cool to actually see what UV light does and how important it is to block it.  I put the light through the lens to test it and it  really did block most of the light.  Awesome value for the money.
I am on my computer nearly all day[9527] and these glasses really work. My eye strain has been reduced and my eyes are less tired. My eye doctor also recommended these glasses to help with night glare. I tried[9527] and they work. The supplier is very responsive and followed up to be sure I was satisfied with my purchase.
Fit well and look good!
These are super lightweight . Love the colors for both these pair . I wear them all day as I’m on the computer and they have drastically reduced my headaches
I bought these for myself and my son. I am only computer a lot and often get headaches. Since wearing these my headphones are not too bad.
I’d say these are for men and men only. My head is a normal size I’d say for female and they were sliding off my head. My husband loves them though! I did love the blue light tester[9527] it was cool to see the effectiveness.
Glasses are stylish and fit great.  Bought these for our teenagers to use while at the computer.  They say they work!
They are perfect
I bought this pair of glasses for me to help me in blocking sun and light but it was very cute on me that I converted one of the frames with my reading lenses and I'm loving it. It looks so rich even though is affordable.
Super cute!!!!  I love these frames!  I can never find cute glasses that look nice on me but actually look really cute and are a good quality too.  I like to use these when I'm sitting at my desk at work to help prevent the blue light damage but  also love that I look really cute too!
  Seem to work. Reasonably comfortable
Love the product[9527] great fit[9527] light weight[9527] wouldn't go without them now!
I absolutely live these! I work in an office 13 hours a day and get massive headaches 4 hours in. These have helped me so much! I love that they are super soft and flexible too. Most glasses are tight on my temple area and actually cause headaches. These don't at all because they're so flexible. I have also received compliments on how cute they look.
This set comes with 2 pairs of glasses[9527] one with black frames[9527] one with brown frames. These glasses are very comfortable and stylish. I was surprised at how much it changed the color of my screen (more bright). I could tell the difference in my eye fatigue the first day using them. These are a must for anyone with a job that has them staring at a computer screen all day.
  Love the style and quality of these glasses especially for the price!  The 2 pack was perfect and they’re better quality than the single pair we’d previously bought which cost more for just 1! Even the packaging is cute. Definitely recommend!
Love these[9527] super cute & make my eyes feel comfortable when I have to stare at my laptop all day. My boyfriend loves his pair too
I work at a desk on the computer all day and would get killer head aches. I just bought these to give them a shot and they really work. My head aches stopped. They are so cute and the square frames would look good on anybody! I love the 2 color options to help match my outfit.
They do what they say they do they're great!
If someone is looking at you they are very tinted and glared[9527] don’t recommend
Great glasses they are super comfortable and great for gaming! They take a lot of stress off my eyes and let me look at my screens with out stress on my eyes
Great for people who use computers and phones a lot. It rests your eyes and does not tire.
I can't calcuulate how many hours I expend in fron of my desktop PC or my phone. I started to have some head pain at nights. With this I feel better. I feel this is safe[9527] and they look so cool. Glad they come in 2 pack.
I didnt really notice how much of a strain on my eyes looking st my phone screen or ipad was until I put these on. Easy to wear  and I noticed the difference right away. Glad I got a 2 pack so my daughter can wear these too.
  Great for daily use.
  I have definitely noticed that since I started wearing these in the evenings when using my phone or tablet[9527] that I’m able to fall asleep faster. The lenses look clear with just this slight bit of color when you hold them to the light.  And work well with good clarity. They’re light weight and comfortable to wear. And have made a difference with my trouble falling asleep.<br><br>I’d talked with a friend about my insomnia problem a few weeks ago and she explained how the light from electronic devices[9527] including TVs and phones[9527] cause some people to have trouble falling asleep[9527] and suggest I get blue light blocking glasses.<br><br>Very glad I did. Nice quality product at a good price.
  If you stare at a screen you need these not the most stylish but do the job
  These blue-light glasses look great[9527] are comfortable[9527] and noticeably reduce eye strain when using a computer.  I am typically in front of a screen 7-10 hrs a day for my work[9527] and by the end of the day my eyes are definitely strained.  I tested these glasses over several days of extended use[9527] and they made a huge difference in reducing that eye strain.<br><br>HOWEVER[9527] the lenses in these glasses are ridiculously reflective[9527] both on the inside and outside of the lenses.  (see photo - insides of lenses are the same.)  In fact[9527] I took them off multiple times because the lens reflections were so distracting I couldn't easily focus on the computer screen.  At the end of the day[9527] I can't recommend these glasses because of that reflectivity.  It is just too distracting for when you are trying to work.<br><br>Note: I received full reimbursement for this product in exchange for an honest product review.
Glasses seem a little small[9527] but product works as advertised.
Quality product[9527] fast delivery.
Son perfectas[9527] en el trabajo de oficina o para jugar[9527] muy ligeras y una vez que te acostumbras a ellas[9527] ni te das cuenta de que las traes puestas.
They are a little big for my face but you can really feel the difference when you put them on...like an instant relief
  These glasses are eye savers They’re light weight to wear all day for distance learning[9527] blocking out the blue light. After school when my son is playing video games[9527] he wears them too. The frame style is attractive and very universal for different face shapes. Quality materials are used for the lenses and the frames. Getting two pairs of glasses add a very low price is very satisfying[9527] basically getting two pairs for the price of one. We are very pleased with the effectiveness of this product. Give them a try[9527] I believe you will be satisfied too!!
Got them for my bro in law for a grad present and he loves them! My sis says he won’t take them off.??
Good fit for average sized head (teenage/adult sized daughter). Kids are on screens so much more these days and she likes to wear fake glasses anyways[9527] so hitting two birds with one stone here. They do have a slightly brownan tint to the lenses[9527] but it’s not noticeable.
They shipped quickly[9527] looked exactly as shown in pics[9527] have helped reduce eye pain from blue light. Very satisfied
Now that my daughter is doing homeschool and looking at a screen more. These are helping.
  As someone who has to constantly be looking at a screen all day[9527] these glasses are a total godsend.<br>They are comfortable and I feel like they really make a difference.
As someone who runs a small business online[9527] I spend a ton of time on my computer and phone (including right now). Im constantly experiencing eye strain and headaches from staring at screens[9527] so I read that these glasses can help relieve those side effects. First[9527] the shape of these glasses are perfect. They aren’t chunky and fake looking. They are definitely reflective[9527] in that you can tell they aren’t regular prescription glasses by looking in the mirror. However[9527] I’m totally okay with that because I work from home and the benefits I feel I’m getting from these totally outweigh the reflections.  The headaches have tapered off with these[9527] so I plan to keep wearing them!
they were exactly like the picture and fit great!!
I bought the 2-pack and love them!  Thank you[9527] Madeyes!  I have not had a headache since using them - that's a win right there!!
Absolutely satisfied with these...it is kind of hard at first to get used to them[9527] but they do the job perfect!  My eyes feel relieved by the end of the day[9527] and they are stylish at a bargain price!  Got so many compliments on them.<br><br>Love them.
I had blue light glasses before but these work much better. They have a tint to them and they help reduce the strain on your eyes. I constantly use them for watching tv and being on my phone. I use to get headaches all the time since my job requires technology but since using these they have reduced.
These are a totally pretty cool. I had lasik surgery and I wanted to order glasses that would help lessen the glare of blue light and stuff. It really does help. I would reccomend it.
I wear these all day long[9527] staring at computer monitors for hours on end. For the price[9527] I'm super happy with these and the designs/colors are a plus as well.
Scratch very easy
I do really like these glasses[9527] especially for the price you can’t beat that. However they do slightly have a yellowish tint and glare when using them. Other then that they are great.
Just I love it.
Although it is very cheap[9527] the style is too earthy for old people to use
Was looking for some blue light glasses to help out with the strain for eyes.  I am on my computer at work[9527] at home and even while studying and taking exams.<br>I didn’t want to purchase expensive ones -since I wasn’t sure how this was going to work out.  The frames are pretty sturdy and the colors of frames were cute.  They came within and box and each with a bag – so I can keep in my purse easily enough.  It has helped me with just the tiredness of my eyes and small headaches that I used to get.  I think for the price and the relief I am getting from just general eye stain when using my computer has been very much worth it.
  So my wife got these for me since I work on the computer all day and I have noticed that my eyes are not as tired as they would get and I don’t have headaches like I did with staring at the computer for hours at a time. Plus[9527] she said they make me look like Clark Kent so that’s cool.
Arrived quickly and work well!
This is a third time purchase. Better looking frame and color.
Not the best quality or design.
First of all[9527] let me just say the customer service with this seller is absolutely amazing. My delivery was missing in the mail [9527] they immediately sent me replacement.<br><br>I love my glasses ! Less eye strain and less headaches ! I am on my computer 18 hours a day and these help a lot! The yellow tint is definitely something to get used too but it isn't bad ! It blocks out the blue light so thats all that matters!
My eyes actually felt better after started using these glasses!  It's a bit big for my small face[9527] but that's not a big deal.
This are miracle workers! I work at a cubicle for 9 hours a day. After the first few weeks[9527] I noticed I started having headaches after or even during my shift. I kid you not[9527] these glasses worked immediately. I will never go to work without them. They’re also very stylish! I keep one in my purse(it comes with a drawstring pouch to hold them) and one at my desk.
These glasses arrived in a sturdy box which included a small UV light to test efficacy. They have a lifetime guarantee! They are lightweight[9527] comfortable and seem to be helping to reduce my headaches while looking at a screen.
I like the glasses price[9527] quality and packaging. Very happy with the purchase.
Great item and seller! Very happy with my purchase.
Loved this item! They fit great and served their purpose!
I work in IT[9527] so I’m constantly looking at computer screens. I decided it was time to try a pair of blue light blocking glasses...gotta say I’m not disappointed! These glasses are super cute on and they really work. I sleep better at night[9527] and have fewer migraines. At first I was skeptical about buying these glasses but I’m so glad I did! Don’t regret buying these in the slightest! I wear them every day :)
These were amazing I think everyone should get them at their eyes are messed up from computer screens.
Cute[9527] comfortable[9527] and effective! I’ve spread all the news to my coworkers!
I stare at a computer all day for work.  The eye strain was not pleasant[9527] there were times when my vision became blurry.  Since wearing these for work I no longer have any eye strain.  Very happy with these.  I have recommended them to several co-workers.
We received 2 pair pretty quickly. My teen  daughter uses them and believes her eyes feel better when using the computer.  She looks really cute in them.  She's 16 and they look just a touch big on her face[9527] but they are very stylish on her.  We are pleased with the purchase.
Very cheaply made of flimsy plastic that has a terrible glare when you’re actually wearing them. They also make everything yellow[9527] and make things too dark to wear them indoors (which defeats the whole purpose as I work in an office job). I know yellow is used to combat blue but I’ve had other blue light blocking glasses and it wasn’t nearly this bad
they work great
Since I was teaching from home I found myself with more eye fatigue and less sleep. Tried these to combat the blue light affect on sleep. I have slept better!

I tried a pair previous to these and they were flemsy and hard to clean. These are sturdy[9527] easy to clean[9527] not foggy and look good as well. Thumbs up for sure! Even my husband got on board!
Great product
  I wanted clear-lens eyeglasses that block UVA/UVB[9527] because I have macular degeneration and must always block sun.  I'm outdoors in early morning or in evening often[9527] and at those times sunglasses are too dark.  These glasses solve the problem.  They come with a little blue-light flashlight so you can test any pair of glasses for blue-light blocking.
Glasses came really nicely boxed. 2 pairs for the price is great. I have been using them for about a week[9527] and they definitely help. I work on the computer a lot.  and best part I have had less headaches..So its a WIN!
Not sure how much of the effect is placebo[9527] but I’m definitely glad I bought them
These are awesome! I work at a computer for 12 hours a day[9527] and these immediately stopped my eyes from hurting.  Plus they're cute ??
With ordinary glasses no difference[9527] looks like an ornament[9527] no effect
These are awesome!!! I have bad headaches due to light sensitivity and these help so much on the bad days. They are also super cute and frame face well!
These glasses really work to block the blue. Great value comfortable light weight great style.
  Great buy. They don’t work that well for video conferencing as they have a strong blue glare but I am happy with the purchase.
I grabbed these to try because I spend all day looking at computer screens and often have a headache and tired eyes at the end of the day.  Amazingly these really do cut the glare without “dimming” the lights so they are very helpful.
I’ve really noticed a difference wearing these glasses I front of a screen. They’re the talk of my office! I’ve let my coworkers try them on[9527] they notice a difference immediately. I’ve sent them this link and they’ve all showed interest in buying this product!
Light[9527] helpful[9527] but disappointed that they were not to comfortable.
Very comfortable and light weight. Haven’t had any headaches from staring at screens for 8+ hours a day!!  Blue light filter works great.
I just started using these glasses because I'm either always on my phone or on the computer[9527] I've heard a lot about them and have been meaning to give them a try and I finally did! It's awesome how it works[9527] I have extremely sensitive eyes so to have these handy is great. It came with two pairs and I'll be giving the other pair to my mom!
Lightweight[9527] fit great[9527] work great[9527] cheap! I bought a much more expensive pair from a more well known company you probably all get Instagram notifications about and they were expensive[9527] don’t fit well and broke easily. These are great[9527] especially for the price. Recommend!
I have a couple pairs of blue blocking glasses already but wanted to get more for my family members. These are good glasses and definitely help your eyes not to strain.  Tthey come in black and brown. They are in a box with both pairs.
The glasses hit my face well. They are effective at blocking the blue light and help us college students wind down for sleep after studying all day. Plus[9527] the glasses help prevent the "I've been staring at my laptop for too long" burn. They are light weight and fit in with current styles.
Just what I needed.
I like these[9527] I find the eye strain to be much less and I don’t go into a “fog” when I look away from the computer like I used to
Glasses work. Very lightweight. I use them regularly.
Love this!
Both of them came out perfect. I loved both color but the black is just awesome. It's not too big not too small. And this glass works exactly like the normal computer glass you buy for higher price. I bought 4 computer glasses and kept this and returned other 3. This is just perfect.
Got these for my husband and myself since we were spending a lot more time in front of our computers.  I findy eyes are not hurting at the end of the day anymore and I rarely get headaches from work.  Def a must buy!
I was Recommended to try s pair of these Blue Light Blicking glasses.  I’ve been working a lot in a computer.  My eyes have been bothering me. The day I ordered a pair[9527] a friend posted she bought a pair.  They REALLY DO BLOCK BLUE LIGHT ! You. An tell while wearing them and on the computer. I HUGE difference . My hubby even said the FRAMES looked GREAT ! You can’t beat the PRICE and you get 2pair !  HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
This has helped ease the stress on my eyes.  I am glad I purchased these glasses!
These seemed to help the light strain on my<br>Eyes but they also made things very distorted that made it hard to focus.
These are fantastic! They block of the light from the computer and really make a difference. I sit at a computer all day and these seem to help with my headaches/migraines. 10/10 would recommend
  Although I am not using them for gaming[9527] they are the best blue light glasses I have ordered. The quality[9527] the clearest lenses. These are worth the purchase.
  My eyes instantly felt better. I work in IT and staring at screens all day is bad for my eyes. These glasses really help!
I was looking for blue light blocking glasses for me to use everyday because I’m constantly in front of the screen from work and also I had eye lasik last year so I’d like to take care of my eyes.<br><br>So as you can see on the photos that I uploaded[9527] I like how they wrapped the packaging with plastic so I know the product is brand new. I had a bad experience previously when I ordered my product through amazon and the seller sent me a used item and it was very clear that it has been used and returned. I never like receiving an item that was returned from a previous owner and sell it back to another buyer that is just wrong. I’m sure no one would appreciate that. Due to covid[9527] you never know where it came from.<br><br>So anyway....  Also I loveee how it came with two pairs! I like having two so I can use the other one for work and one for personal use. I wore both glasses and boy its very lightweight and very very very comfortable!!! I like how i pull the arms open and it just opens easily and fits in my face perfectly.<br><br>So I wore it for couple of days just to see how it is. I have no problem with it I can use it for computer use[9527] watching tv[9527] use my phone and ipad before going to bed because I didn’t want any blue light when using my gadgets before going to bed.<br><br>The only thing that I don’t like is the two dots design on the glasses because it looked kinda awkward but it is not that a big of a deal.<br><br>Other than that[9527] it really protects your eyes because I did the test as you can see on the picture that I uploaded the other side is white means it got the glasses on there while the other side is not protected.
I purchased these because my optometrist has been recommending that I purchase a pair for a couple of years now. I started a new job that requires more screen time and I noticed that my eyes are tired by the end of the day. I went ahead and purchased these based on price and looks. There are a lot of choices out there[9527] but I wanted something that was pretty. These are very nice. they are the style of glasses that I used to wear before lasik. So far I like them. And I do notice that I am not squinting as much during the day. I also don't feel like I have eye strain the way that I did before. The price was great too. I gave one pair to my co-worker[9527] who spends even more time in front of a computer than I do. They are very stylish.
on time and nice. My 20 year old loves them!
The functionality of these glasses meet my expectations. I don’t like the way the black frames look on me but I know the brown frames. They also fall down my face when I look down. Totally worth the price. I was getting horrible headaches and eye fatigue from staring at a computer all day. No more headaches (from the computer at least)
These glasses not only look good[9527] but also help to reduce eye strain. My headaches disappeared and I was able to work for longer periods of time on my laptop.
Great price
These glasses work so well. I've had other blue light glasses that are very flimsy and break pretty easily. These seem to work really good and be really sturdy I haven't even had to break out the second pair yet. I will definitely be buying from this person again if I need another pair of bluelight glasses.
Looks like high quality!! Can’t wait to try them out.
Bought these because my eyes have been bothering me at work after staring at the computer for hours.  I do feel they help block all of the blue light our eyes are exposed too.  As of now I think they are helping to relieve some of the strain.  An adde bonus is they are very stylish and reasonably priced.
Helps with light sensitivity due to staring at the monitor all day. Reduces tension and straining. Worth the money!!
At first I did not get the double pack as I’d ordered[9527] but costumer service was great at getting me what I order. I love using these glasses in this new time of so much more technology use for work. I can tell they block the light well. They are also very stylish. I would definitely recommend them.
they are way too yellow looking and hurt my eyes. they look horrible on.
These are terrible quality. I have many inexpensive blue blocking glasses in different styles and none other than these make the screen difficult to read[9527] give me a headache[9527] and make my skin look jaundiced through the lenses. The lenses actually look blue instead of clear like my others.
Like
Great size! Others I've tried were too large[9527] finally found some that aren't huge on my face
I can’t imagine how these could reduce anyone’s eye strain. The coating on them makes it difficult to focus.
  Purchased because I work at a computer for long hours daily. Was starting to experience more frequent headaches and eye strain. Purchased these to filter the blue light. So far[9527] so good. Eyes don't feel nearly as tired and less headaches.
They work great and fit very well[9527] they are very comfortable.
As soon as I punt these glasses on[9527] I could tell an astronomical difference by the look of the screen. By effectively blocking out all of the blue light[9527] my screen has been way easier to look at[9527] and has helped my game for long periods of time without straining my eyes. The packaging was beautiful[9527] and came with carrying bags for each of the glasses. As well as the bags[9527] the product came with a LED blue light tester[9527] just to prove on how much light these glasses deflected! Overall I have been wearing these on a daily basis and will continue to wear them due to their amazing quality and efficiency. 100% would recommend this item if you stare at a screen all day[9527] or even just for a few hours. They're stylish and actually work great!
I'm pretty disappointed with these glasses.
I really like this product. I have had for about two weeks or so. I have purchased similar glasses from Amazon before a few times and these ones are my favorite. They’re really stylish and comfortable. I like the size of the lens[9527] it’s big but not too big and chunky. It fits very well and comes in very nice packaging. I have a problem with migraines so I need glasses like these to help reduce eye strain
Great style and comfy fit.  Seemed to really reduce blue light. BUT I need them for meetings and the glare is horrible. All viewers see is the reflection of my computer screen.
Perfect. Lightweight and stylish. Came so we'll packaged and constantly receive compliments on them.
These glasses have definitely helped me not get headaches as often. I wear them when using my phone[9527] computer or watching TV.
Such cute glasses with a comfortable wear!! I wear glasses to correct my vision but they also have blue light protection lenses that have helped my headaches tremendously so when my daughter started high school this year she mentioned I wish they had glasses like that for ppl that dont have vision issues and then I came across these and she loves them. She has noticed less tiredness in her eyes throughout the day and feels cute and confident in them! Also[9527] it comes with a blue light tester its reasuring to know that the product does what it says it should do! Great Product!
I received one black and one tortoise style. The glasses fit my face well and are comfortable. The only thing I wish I had known prior to my purchase is the glasses really have a distinct yellow tint. I wear them while working from home and they really have helped eliminate my headaches from staring at a computer screen all day. When I forget to wear them I notice my head hurts again after working and my eyes feel strained and tired.
Wow wow wow. Came in a nice box. With cloth pouches for each pair. AND even a blue light testing kit[9527] to see it is actually working! the frames look awesome[9527] simple and exactly as advertised. I think sometimes these companies try to make a one size fits all and end up with bulky frames but these have a nice thing look. Was free one day shipping with prime. I bought them for my bf and now I'm going to get another pair for myself!
i work on the computer 12 hours a day[9527] these glasses saved me from headaches. definitely worth the money and super stylish looking glasses. comfortable to wear and very light weight. recommend for people who works on the computer a lot or read books alot
I bought these for work and enjoyed them the first couple of days. However[9527] they smudge way to easily and even after cleaning have a foggy look to them. Disappointed :(
I was getting headaches daily. I work on my computer for 6hrs+ a day so I thought I would give these a shot. My husband pointed out that I wa as squinting while on the computer also but at my eye appointment my vision was almost perfect. These definitely help me out
Pretty nice blue light blocking glasses for the price in a fancy box.
I read some negative reviews but for myself[9527] these are awesome. I like many of you[9527] am quarantined working from home. Stuck to the computer for most of my day. I wear contacts[9527] so these are a great additional help for my eyes. These truly do help bring out the colors and are very comfortable. I’m no longer trying to squint to read. Definitely worth the purchase!
I spend my entire day staring at a screen[9527] and the headaches have been constant. But since I’ve been wearing these glasses[9527] I’ve noticed a huge impact In the amount of strain my eyes are having to endure! I like having two different colors to choose from so I can go back and forth!
**I’VE USED IT EVERY DAY FOR MONTHS**<br><br>After purchasing several glasses from other sellers[9527] I have to say I am finally satisfied with my pair of Bluelight Blocking Glasses.<br><br>Several reasons:<br>1) THIS ONE FITS!!!!! I spent so much time trying to find one that fits. The first pair I ordered was $20 and I had to learn the hard way it was too small and gave me headaches. Second one ran into the same problem.<br><br>2) IT ACTUALLY BLOCKS BLUELIGHT!!!! I cannot emphasize this enough. My first purchase blocked some UV light and was too small. Second purchase - blocked ZERO blue light AND was also too small. I AM SO HAPPPY I finally found a brand that actually blocks it[9527] you would be surprised to find out how many people don’t know how to TEST that it actually blocks blue light.<br><br>3) IT CAME WITH A TESTER: in the box[9527] there’s a little guide on how to do the test. You use a little light to figure it out.<br><br>4) STYLISH!! While searching the market for this product[9527] I found so many glasses were super unstylish and ugly. Luckily this one wasn’t. It has a hipster frame. It’s trendy. I love it and it makes me look good!<br><br>5) COMES WITH A NICE CARRYING POUCH: the carrying pouch functions as a cloth cleaner to wipe down the glasses as well. This way I don’t get any scratches and I don’t have to bother myself with a small cloth I have to take out from the pouch.<br><br>CONS:<br>Can’t really think of any honestly. I don’t remember being this happy with a purchase in a while.
Great price point. Classic look[9527] not super flattering for my face shape but not terrible and very comfortable. I use them for computing and television watching. I needed something for eye strain and headaches and these seem to do the trick.
These look and feel great. Headaches from blue light are a thing of the past. Definitely recommend.
Nice[9527] but a lot of glare.
Love them
These glasses are built well[9527] but the reflective glare is on both the outside of the lens as well as the inside making these only okay to use in complete darkness.
Overall I'm happy with these! They're a little big for me but they're unisex so that makes sense. I notice a huge difference looking at a screen without them after I've been wearing them a while.
I like that they take the eye strain away - but if you depend on you monitor to<br>  deliver acturate color[9527] as I do[9527] take them off when digital painting[9527] photography editing.
Great value
This 2-pack is worth every penny. These glasses are stylish[9527] durable and I can notice a significant difference when I wear them. My roommate who I'm sharing the pack with[9527] also loves his pair and already wears them around the house 24/7! Lol. The sunglass bag is perfect for when I am not wearing them to keep them in nice condition. Lastly[9527] the packaging is outstanding[9527] I would recommend these to a friend.
These have been really helping my kids with their e-learning.
I've combed over the description multiple times and nowhere do I see that these glasses are meant to magnify. Instant headache. Instantly returning. These are blue-tinted reading glasses. I just need the blue blocker[9527] not magnification. Beware.
So glad they came in a 2 pack. My mom and myself both stare at computers or phones all day. These will definitely help with the strain. The only downfall is they are a tiny bit big for my face. Other than that[9527] You can test the blue light block out with the tester in the box.
  i like how weii they work
These are so cute and good quality especially for the money!! The leopard ones are definitely much cuter than the black but i love both!
My uses these at college.  She really likes them and the little test kit they send you was really cool and helps you realize how well they work.  Wish they were a tad smaller - but she has a small head.
Nice and study frames. Very helpful in reducing eye strain.
This glasses help reduce strain on the eyes while watching TV or working on the computer late at night and allow for a more restful sleep to occur.
Purchased for online scoring; seemed to prevent eye strain
  I ordered a few different pairs[9527] but these seemed to block out more than any others. My husband even started wearing the second pair and first thing he said was that he hadn’t noticed how much his eyes were straining. These have become part of our nightly routine. They fit both of us well; I have a tiny head and his is pretty big. Plus[9527] they actually look good!
Dont like
These work really well. I’m on a computer at work 40+ hours a week and I’ve noticed in wearing these[9527] I don’t get the eye strain in the afternoon that I normally get. There’s a slight yellow tinge when looking at the screen[9527] but for the price and the fact you get two different pairs[9527] it’s great!
I am really sad about the fact that this glasses were really cheaply done on the glass side. The glass on the lenses was very warped which is very inconvenient and uncomfortable to see with[9527] I really wish I could get my money back for this item
Both fit well[9527] perfect for computer work.
  Great for working from home[9527] so far so good
  Gamer teenager likes them. Adult too
My work is 50% behind the screen of a computer and the other 50% will use my phone for everything. These lenses are the best to protect my eyesight. They are light and I loved their shape. When the work day is hard[9527] my red eyes betray my strong day. With these lenses my eyes have a 100% rest and it is reflected in my face and in the headaches that came at the end of the day.<br><br>It comes with a tester. which demonstrates the damage that the computer and telephone rays do to the eyes. They are super CHICK. well sexy ... my wife has the other pair. (addicted to his tablet). I highly recommend them
computer
My sister had been complaining about headaches & insomnia from working in front of a screen all day. I gifted these to her[9527] she said they made a huge difference! They arrived in a nice box & both glasses inside were in their own bag case.
These work great to save my eyes from working on the computer all day. They are super stylish too! They come in a nice box and they each have a separate bag to store them in. Very nicely packaged and made. So glad I purchased.
I took a blind gamble on these 'Blue-Light Blocking ' glasses and after several hours/days of use[9527] my final verdict is "Just Average All Around'. I've cut my losses ($20 for a 2-pack) and will look at other productss[9527] after some research.
Very happy i got these glasses. They are stylish[9527] well made and don't look cheap. Comfortable to wear and pretty light weight. Totally worth the money paid.
I loved the frames and shape of these[9527] however[9527] the lenses are VERY yellow and look really bad on. From a distance they look yellow and blue. I would never wear these to work[9527] so I returned them. Definitely low quality.
Very comfortable! Nice style also fit on me
  These glasses just arrived today and I was already tell that they are great quality. They are super simple and cute[9527] not to mention they fit my face perfectly! I would definitely reccomend this product.
These are super cute and comfortable! I got Lasic surgery a few years ago and while I love that[9527] sometimes I miss wearing glasses! Picking them out was always fun and they look cute when you’re having a comfy day in sweats. Now I feel like I get the best of both worlds[9527] plus they do a great job blocking the blue light.
I used to have headache problem by using computer while working. After using it for over a week now[9527] the problem is almost gone and I'm pretty sure after a month use it wi be gone. Very helpful and protects eyes from harmful blue lights
Using it as a blue light blocker.<br><br>Pros:<br>+ sexy packaging<br>+ quality<br>+ color<br><br>Cons:<br>- not suitable for designers because it changes colours to yellowish ones<br><br>Overall: 4.75/5
  These glasses are useless! Like most people these days[9527] I've recently had to transition to teaching online for the time being. The extra computer time began hurting my eyes and my last pair of blue light glasses were lost when I moved this month. I'm used to wearing glasses (usually contacts)[9527] so the glare[9527] etc. is no problem for me typically. However[9527] these are horrible. When I'm on a zoom call[9527] my entire screen is 100% visible in the reflection of my glasses. No matter how I set the brightness of my screen[9527] the entire thing is visible which makes them useless for teaching. Moreover[9527] the glare in my peripheral vision makes it impossible to focus on my screen because the glare is so distracting. As I said[9527] this is not my first pair of blue light glasses and definitely not my first pair of glasses[9527] but these are te worst I've ever used. Disappointed is an understatement.
Awesome!!!!
Oh my they works great! I am on the computer most of the day and it helps my eyes from being tired and the glare from starring at the computer all day. It even comes with a blue light before you put them on. You can test them.very much Love ?? yes I wear contacts any I have no problems
  Love using these to help my eyes. My husband uses them while working at a computer all day. It has definitely helped with the strain on his eyes. I have been using the second pair when I know I will be on my phone or bingewatching. It was definitely helped my eyes as well.. Less head aches and eye strain. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking at a screen all day.  They are a little big on my face[9527] but fit my husband well.
I have another pair from Amazon that I absolutely love[9527] so I ordered this set so I could have one to leave at my house as well as a set for my fiance. These were not the same as the ones I already have. The lenses definitely have a yellow tint to them which bothered me a little bit. Not a deal breaker though. The deal breaker is the haze in them. When I first put them on I thought they were just really dirty and needed to be cleaned[9527] but after a good cleaning with a wet and dry cloth[9527] I couldn't get rid of it. It almost made me feel dizzy. I thought maybe I had ordered ones with a slight prescription or something[9527] but I didn't.
These glasses are great if you are working on a screen for the majority of the day. They are both neutral colors so look nice and fit well on most head sizes.  Great for reducing blue light eye strain!
I like the way my eyes don`t burn after 5 hours on the computer.
These glasses saved my eyesight! I spend hours each day doing tedious work and staring at multiple screens. Eye fatigue[9527] twitches[9527] and impaired vision were things I would experience nearly every day. After using the glasses[9527] these hindrances have become less of an issue for me (almost nonexistent). Can't live without these glasses!
If you have eye strain because of being on the computer for hours then this is your answer.. My eyes get dry and start burning when I am on the computer for a couple hours.  I find myself rubbing my eyes a good bit. These glasses make the light of the computer so much better.  At the end of the day it is so nice to be able have eyes that are not tired and strained.
I’ve been using these for about a month and they have really helped with any eye strain while working on the computer. The only reason I did 4 stars was because the blue tint is so reflective that when I’m doing my online teletherapy[9527] the client can’t see my eyes. So I only wear them for busy work rather than during live interactions.
  For gaming and screen time[9527] these help eye strain.
This packaging really stands out[9527] quality sturdy box and product itself. Great job!
Great price point[9527] super cute[9527] would highly recommend
Well[9527] what can I say... I thought I'd be getting better sleep with these glasses. Sure I'd say my sleep quality is definitely better since wearing them for a few hours before bed BUT the quantity of sleep I'm getting has drastically decreased due to my wife's uncontrollable irresistibility to me wearing them. If the fire needs stoking[9527] these glasses are right up your alley.
WHAT A CHEAP QUALITY PRODUCT!
10/10[9527] highly recommend. My headaches are gone and contacts arent dried out at end of day.<br><br>Very comfortable[9527] i have a large head and these fit very well.
very nice products .<br>purchased both for my wife who spend all day infront of the computer . she said its help her oit. .would recommended to the people who works under computer and uses more phone .
I ordered these for myself[9527] and my daughter took over my extra pair. She’s been sleeping better since beginning to use them. I need to order a couple more pairs now.
Arrived earlier than expected and very well packaged.  Eases out looking at a computer screens for a long time.  My eyes say thanks.
They came in a box and also individual cases (pouch). They are flexible and comfortable to wear.
It's like they fit any shaped face[9527] my son's included. Excellent quality and really do cut down on the blue light[9527] it's amazing. I ordered the black and tortoise and they are very high quality looking[9527] you would never know how cheap they were. Seem durable too.
These work out perfectly for work and to have an extra set for home.  They slide down on my nose because I need a adjustable Nose pads for my face but it’s not terrible.  They help with the lighting in the building also.  It was weird to wear them at first but now I can’t function for very long with out them at work!
  At the end of the day[9527] my eyes feel less blurry and tired from squinting at bright screens. Less migraines too. A must have during COVID work-from-home times!
Absolutely loved it!! I wish I had known sooner! Totally makes a difference i gave a pair to my mom she uses them on top of her prescription glasses and she's very happy!!!
  Two for the price of one. They work as advertise and you can't beat the price
Omg Im obsessed!!! They are so nice looking!!! The frames are stunning colors and the blue shade make it look so much better[9527] and that’s for the look only! So good to use it when you work and have light exposure[9527] also purse. I’m so in love
Great glasses. Bought them for myself but my teenagers took them from me to use[9527] so I had to buy another set.
Great blue light blocker for those long hours of computer work we all seem to do[9527] then switch over to our phones. Don't notice them on because they are light and comfortable. The 2 colors are standard black and tortoise shell but attractive enough. Hopefully more committees to come. Price was fair
  I am using the glasses for on line teaching. Helps with the eye strain and the glare from the computer.
I stare at a computer most of the day and I can definitely say these are doing something good with my eyes! I think it’s making me squint less which helps me not get a headache. Definitely worth trying out!
Light weight. Helps with glare.
  These are great glasses. Have been helping my eye strain and headaches when on computer[9527] iPad[9527] phone or even tv.. haven’t had a headache in a few days .
I was pretty surprised[9527] the glasses really do block  out blue light. As soon as you put them on[9527] everything looks different. As someone that works at the computer all day long[9527] sometimes I will just randomly get a headache. I wear glasses already but adding the blue light lens is an additional expense when getting glasses and my prescription isn’t strong to begin with. This was an easy and effective solution.
These work so well! And super stylish[9527] definitely recommend buying
Love them! So cute and wonderful packaging. Seem to be very well made. Use them on my computer at work 8+ hours a day and at home for phone/laptop. I can tell I'm not straining my eyes as before. Would purchase again.
I used to watch TV with sunglasses due to eye strain (my kids thought I looked stupid). Now eye look sophistacted! Ha Ha! I do love them - what a relief to my eyes and everything isn't dark from sunglasses. They also are great for night driving reducing glare from oncoming traffic.
I previously had purchased a pair of expensive ($100+) reading glasses.  While they were absolutely fantastic & stylish[9527] I lost them after ~6 months!  Instead of spending another $100[9527] I spent $20 on two pairs.  While these aren't nearly as stylish[9527] and have a distinct blue glare when held up against reflective light[9527] the product definitely gets the job done[9527] and the blue light is noticeably blocked.  Would absolutely recommend as a "starter" kit.
I love these glasses they were per5and I get tons of compliments
Great style.
So far the glasses look good and light. Price-wise its a good deal.
Love these glasses! My eyes don't feel so strained when working in front of my computer.  Highly recommend.  :)
My eyes were dry when using my iPad—the glasses works great and no longer have issues with my eyes. I also ordered for 2 other people and they say the glasses has protected their eye issues as well
Lightweight[9527] affordable
The price is perfect for the quality of these glasses.
I bought these glasses for my husband and I who both spend a lot of time on our phones[9527] tablets and computer for work. I’ve been wanting to reduce our exposure to blue light and any harm it may be doing. I had read a lot about how blue light exposure can mess with sleeping patterns because of the production of melatonin etc. I’m glad I found these glasses. They come in a two pack and are super cute! The dark frames suit my husband and I just love the turtle shell frames. We use them when using our devices (constantly) and I feel like we are feeling the benefits of blocking the blue light already. I especially make sure that in the evening before bed we are wearing them and I feel like I can relax and wind down easier than in the past. We are using our devices more than ever before but not without detriment. I’m so happy to have found these to help combat harmful effects!
Glasses are perfect for staring at a work computer all day. Took a star away because there were minor lens scratches on each pair so I need to buy a new set. Highly recommend
I received the glasses today[9527] but I think they are not good[9527] the style and quality are not satisfied[9527] I applied for a refund!
Helps with headaches. Comfortable
They really help with eye fatigue!
I always get sore eyes after using the computer for awhile. So I bought these to see if they’ll work. It doesn’t work for me due to the design is bad and quality didn’t good.
  These have really helped with eye strain and dry eyes. I spend 12 hours a day looking at various home and work screens and these glasses have really helped with keeping my eyes comfortable.
Bought these for my husband and I both[9527] as we are on computers for over 8 hours a day.  I think they have helped with eye strain and I love the style!  Wish they had bifocals though.  Would be great to not have to take them off to use my readers!
Bought these to save my husband and son from eye damage during hours of gaming. They are both happy with them and wearing them!
I purchased these glasses for my Husband for Christmas.  He loves them!!!  His eyes don't get as tired when he's playing games on the computer.  They're very stylish and sturdy.
Has helped a lot
I like them; definitely notice a difference!
I love these glasses. i wear them at night whole Im on my phone or watching TV. They have helped with my sleeping problems. They have a cute design and are made really well.
Nice frames[9527] solid case[9527] good proce.
Good product. I just didn’t like it a yellow tint
  my son was very very very pleased
I love both pairs. They are light and comfy!
As a receptionist I work on a computer all day and am under florescent lights so my eyes take a beating. These have help so much.. I Still have tired eyes but fewer headaches or blurry vision.comes with 2 pairs of glasses[9527] cleaning cloth[9527] and cord holder for around your neck[9527] and cloth carrying pouch. Worth the price
  I notice I have less headaches while I'm on the computer and these are very light weight. I tested the glasses with the blue light and card it came with[9527] it blocked out all the blue light. The glasses seem very sturdy. Fantastic buy!
usually I don't write the review. I love this product.  I wear them for more than 4 hours and I don't feel any headache or tired eyes. it's look very royal and expensive when you wear them.

My eyes feel more rested after using these.  My eye dr told me that these would be helpful being in front of the computer all the time.  The eye drs can tell by the pictures of ppl wear these to protect their eyes so I’m going to start wearing them all the time.
Spending 10+ hours a day staring at a computer screen really does a number on my eyes (and brain!). These glasses were just what I needed to help with that. They’ve made it so much easier to do my job without feeling like I can’t see at the end of the day! I’ve started wearing my contacts to work exclusively so that I can use these.
I purchased this set of blue light blocking glasses because I have suffered eye strain and issues due to substantial use of computers as an online school teacher. After using these just a few times[9527] I already feel better about my computer use.  My eyes are less strained. The two pack has a pair of black frames and a pair of brown frames. There is a small instruction book and cloth cases for protection when carrying in my purse.<br>Since it is a two pack[9527] I can leave one at home and carry the other with me for extended time using the cell phone.<br>The kit comes with a little blue light to shine on the white spot on the small business type card. I have played with this and it is interesting. Also the instruction book explains that these are reading glasses as well as blue light.<br>All in all[9527] I am very happy and satisfied with this product. I will be having family and friends try mine and encouraging them to purchase this product.
Super cute glasses!!! Great deal and they work very well!!
Great glasses
The lenses have a very unflattering yellow cast and blue hue to them. The frames are nice and the shape/size is nice.
These glasses gave me a huge headache[9527] not recommended
Love these glasses! They are not too large[9527] like ones I have bought in the past[9527] and the colors are great! they really prevent my eyes from getting fatigued when working on the computer for hours! Give these a try!
I am on the computer for about 8 of 9 hours of my shift at work. I noticed my vision getting blurry so I ordered this great set. I have noticed since coming in that the numbers I see on the screen come in clearer.<br><br>Not only that[9527] but I also seem to have slightly better vision with no glasses[9527] but these ones. Since my son only has very far sided vision at this point I hope these keep his eyes from becoming any worse. The fact that there is a pair for him and myself is just a huge bonus that I am so thankful for.
Its as advertised
The product is well packaged. Each glasses is individually placed in a bag. It even comes with a blue-light detector. However[9527] for some reason[9527] everything looks “yellow-ish) after having the glasses on. Not sure if it is due to low power of blue light blocking or something else.
I bought these on my sons’s recommendation and[9527] boy[9527] am I happy I’d did!  Now that we’re “socially distancing” I’m on my tablet much more often and these blue light blocking glasses really help keep my eyes from getting dry and overstressed.  I think they even help my vision from becoming blurred when I’ve been reading on my tablet for a long time.  I’m very happy with this product.
Stylish glasses[9527] comfortable and semi-flexible frame. Definitely significant difference in looking at a screen while wearing them. Reading on my kindle has become far more comfortable! Also a plus: I feel slightly smarter while wearing them. Comes with blue light-flashlight and card to test light blockage. 10/10.
They’re affordable and get the job done. They’ve helped me so much from preventing headaches while working and gaming.
I bought these and another brand. Both have the blue light tester Both blocked the blue light.  These made everything yellow. The other brand just a tiny hint of yellow.  Sending these back.
I ordered these glasses now that I am working from home. They have been great. I gave the other pair to my brother since he is now doing all of his schoolwork from home. He was starting to have migraines from being on his computer all day long[9527] but now with these glasses[9527] those migraines have gone away.
Super cute[9527] love them!
Excelente calidad.
I have been wearing my glasses while on the computer since receiving them. I work on the computer 8-11 hours a day. I have noticed a dramatic decrease in eye fatigue[9527] tiredness[9527] and rubbing my eyes. I no longer have to take breaks from the computer to rest my eyes! I have already recommended these glasses to so many people!
Got for my son and he says that they are really helping .
These were a pleasant surprise. They are very light weight and comfortable to wear. They come in really nice packaging with a soft case for both pairs (doubles as a lens cleaner). I’ve been using it for a few days now and it seems to be improving eye strain. I like that it comes with 2 pairs. I keep one in my room since I’m on my phone (a lot)
  We are in love with these glasses! We work all day with the computer and we can see the change when we wear these glasses. I definitely recommend it[9527] plus they are so cute[9527] you will look amazing wearing it!
My eyes were getting extremely fatigued by the end of the day.  Very dry[9527] sore and overall my vision was being effected.  After using these glasses for the past couple weeks I am already sold. My eye fatigue gas greatly decreased and my dryness has nearly diminished. I was also very imprey with the special care of packaging when being shipped!!
Love them
  It is very light and prevents eye strain especially if you are working on a computer all day.
I really enjoy these glasses when I am working on my computer for an extended amount of time! It really prevents headaches!
Great product. One day of wear relieved eye strain and daily headache since working from home.
This is great for video game players.
The leopard glasses are seriously soo cute on! The glasses seem to be of pretty good quality. I haven’t had any problems with them. I’m currently out of contacts so I haven’t had the pleasure of using the glasses as much as I’d like to. I look forward to using them more to help reduce eye strain from staring at screens all day.
I don't need it. It's uncomfortable
  Glasses came in two pairs as mentioned. I only use th black ones[9527] since the brown has a feminine look into it in  my opinion[9527] so I gift it to my grandmother.  Glass came with bag protector[9527]  but not the actual case. I work 12 hour shifts in front of the computer[9527] and my eyes are usually strained from staring at the screen for hours. This Glasses definitely eased some of those eye strains. Would recommend to other buyers looking for blue light protective glasses.
Definitely blocks out blue light[9527] my eyes feel much less tired than usual! The only downside is they slide down my nose (however my nose is pretty flat) so I constantly am pushing them up[9527] but they look cute[9527] do what they claim[9527] and are very affordable! Highly recommend.
Love it
At first I liked these glasses but as I wore them a while I noticed an annoying reflection on the inside of  the lens.  It's so distracting that I never use them.
SCREEN PROTECTION
Works like advertised
  Glasses are a little karge
Very happy with this purchase.  Two pairs (Black and Tortoise) for only 15$ is a great deal.  Overall very comfortable and after 2 days I can tell I'm not squinting as much at my desk.  Has the thickness and feel of sunglasses.  Highly recommend if you are in front of a monitor or two all day.
  Good quality. Slightly heavy
I had a friend get me a pair of blue light lenses for Christmas. I didn’t notice a big change when I wore them at first but I did start to notice my eyes straining more when I wasn’t wearing them. I picked up this set so I can have one for at home and one for at work and I like these better than the original ones that I got. Definitely worth the price. Even if you don’t think you need these glasses pick up a set. Do your eyes a favor especially if you spend as much time looking at a screen as I do. I’m amazed by the difference that it makes now that my eyes are used to them.
My son recommend that I get some blue light glasses as I am in front of a computer all day.  I got these as they are a good price and I like the design.  I have been using them for a couple of weeks and they really do help with eye strain and the blue tint make it easier to read thing on my desk top.
I work online and computer glasses are a must for me. These glasses are well made and true blue blockers. They came impeccably packaged
  The minute I put these on my eyes immediately felt better. They are very light. Both pair look nice[9527] but are a tad bit big for my face. Even though they are light they do slide a little. But I wouldn't send them back because they work.
I’m obsessed with these! I stare at a computer 8hours a day and my eyes are extremely fatigued by the end of the day! With these I could tell a major difference! And they are cute on!
The glasses I received have helped SO much!  I am an educator who has moved to online and virtual meetings during the pandemic.  I had headaches every single day from so much screen time.  These have made a HUGE difference and  I shared the second pair with my sister[9527] also an educator.  Highly recommend these!!
Loved these glasses[9527] they’re so cute!
I find these useful and they work well!
Great product. Good quality.
I purchased these because me and my co-worker work on computers all day and have resulted to turning all the lights off in the office and turning the backlight way down to make our eyes more comfortable. We both tried these glasses and they actually work! Our next buy was going to be expensive privacy screens so I am glad these work. It comes with two pair so I use the black ones and she likes the brown ones. We have noticed a change in the glare and a decrease in headache and dry eyes. I would highly recommend these for low cost save on your eyes if you work on a computer all day!
These glasses are exactly what I needed. I have to spend hours on my laptop for my job and I always found my eyes hurting and then developing headaches from the screen. I ordered these glasses hoping they would help ease the headaches and my eye strain and it worked! I haven’t had a single headache since I started wearing these during my screen time or after screen time. They are very comfortable and sleek looking too.
Got my glasses this weekend. Two pairs for around about $20[9527] you cant beat that! They came in a sealed box so once i got the plastic off i was confident everything was covid free underneath. The glasses even come with a tiny blue light that you can use to test on the glasses and THEY REALLY WORK! Before these i was using izipizi glasses which were nice but expensive and broke after a year or two. Hopefully these will hold up for longer. So far so good[9527] I am very satisfied with my order. My only small piece of feedback is that i wish they came with a carrying case even if it was the soft kind. Instead they come with super thin dust pouches that double as a lens cloth for wiping. Still not bad at all!
Really enjoyed these glasses. Very comfortable and made my eyes feel less strained when I was working on my computer.
Was lioking for something to stop the glare coming from those blue leds  coming at me when driving and I found these they work great.
Came In a nice box. Fit perfectly. Look great. Great value.
The glasses sit well[9527] the eyes after 8 hours of computer work feel better than before.<br>Time will tell how it helps my eyes to stay healthy.
These are great help a lot i have to use computer all day. My eyes feel much better.
Great purchase- love these!
These glasses are excellent! They definitely block the blue light on my computer and I don’t feel like my eyes strain as much anymore. The price was just right!
I have had a pair of Blue Light Glasses for a while now and I wanted to get a pair for the rest of my family and they absolutely love them! These glasses are high quality and they work very well. They sit comfortably on the face and they are very stylish as well! I highly recommend these glasses!
I recently had a horrific allergic reaction to a lash treatment so my eyes have been tired and sensitive. I couldn't have ordered these at a better time. I stare at a computer most of the day at work and these have made that significantly easier. Reduced eye strain and headaches!
Love them!  No more headaches from sitting in front of the computer all day!
My kids watch a lot of electronics[9527] dont judge.<br>This helps me feel more comfortable with their extended use. Plus what kid doesnt love to wear "glasses".<br><br>Both styles are very stylish and sturdy. Hold up for not only adult use but also child.
I spend a good amount of time looking at a computer screen. These glasses are both functional and comfortable. The frames were sturdy and I felt like I was wearing normal reading glasses. I have noticed after wearing them I’ve had less fatigue. My eyes are able to better focus!
They really do make a difference with the computer.  I am also glad that i bought the 2 pack so i have one for home and one for work.
  These are nice looking with a have good blue lenses in them. The only problem is that they do not stay on the nose very well.  Constantly having to push them up.
Great product and works well. my only complaint is that it didn't come with some kind of cleaning cloth for the blue light lens.
Love the design they are nice looking and comfortable. I wear them while I’m on the computer.
Got these for my sister for Christmas and she was super happy about it. She is on the computer all the time for work so she’s been wanting these. Cute[9527] good price[9527] work well.
Came so quick[9527] my daughter is 7 years old. She uses when she plays with her tablet.
  Glasses are look fashionable and great. while reducing blue light and glare from computer screen
Light weight and comfortable.  I don't wear glasses[9527] but these are great.  No more computer screen headaches!
Not gonna work for me. These keep sliding down my nose. And I’m terribly distracted by my own eyeballs’ reflections. I do not recommend this brand.
  Glasses arrived with a scratch across the middle of lens.
So far so good. Took a day to adjust though. After that I’ve been fine. They seem a little tinted idk if that just how blue light glasses just are but I don’t mind.
After a week[9527] I want to talk about using feelings.  First of all[9527] the shape is pretty.  But flashy and expensive.  Generally speaking[9527] this kind of glasses will be equipped with a small tool and cleaning cloth[9527] but it does not have[9527] I do not know if it is a manufacturer's problem.  The legs on both sides of the glasses are too long. If you want to lie down[9527] the glasses will pinch the pillow[9527] which will affect the use. This makes me a person who often plays mobile phones on the bed and sofa but wants to protect the eyesight.  Bad experience.  So I gave it a star for design.  Because it is very uncomfortable to use[9527] it is not of much use to me and I intend to retire it.  Wanted friends still have to think again
They really help with my daughter in law's headaches.
I love these glasses. They have helped me with eye strain staring at the computer all day. Monitors look more clear and I like the fit and look.
Love these glasses. Went to the eye doctor and he told me how important blue light filters are. These are cute[9527] comfortable and not bothersome at all. So far I really like these.
  Use for computer
The glasses do help while staring at a screen. I am impressed on the difference it makes on eye strain. They are also simple but stylish. It’s nice to have a 2 pack for the price as well. They come nicely packaged as well which adds to the whole aspect. Overall really impressed with these.
I began getting really bad headaches right after I began teaching from home. These glasses have been great and I am no longer having the headaches. I just ordered another pair because my daughters are using them as well with their online classes.
Great quality for the price!
My family and I love these glasses! They are lightweight to wear for a long period of time and not bother your ears. My son is no longer getting headaches when using the computer while wearing these glasses. They have REALLY helped him be able to sit and do his homework. They are a must have if you sit at a computer!
  It shines a lot but rest is fine
I love the Blue light blocking glasses [9527]to protect my daughter[9527] she works a lot on the computer from  her assignment school. She loved it.
  These glasses are very lightweight[9527] but very easy to smudge and hard to clean on the go. I feel like I am cleaning these things multiple times a day[9527] which cuts down on productivity. I probably won't buy more of these
Love these!! Stylish and comfy
Definitely helps after looking a computer all day.
Excellent
  This product does not really work.
  I bought these for distance learning and my son hardly takes them off. Great investment to protect my child’s eyes.
These glasses fits great and works as described. They are stylish and of good quality. Overall these are great if you have prolong use of computer and are great value for money.
Me parecieron super pero con el poco uso que le he dado el crystal se empezo a despintar y le salieron como lineas al crystal.
Decent blockers. Very subtle yellow tint but not annoying. All plastic but for the price they get the job done. Already noticed eye strain relief from staring at my iPad.
Super fast delivery and already utilizing these for remote learning!
Love these!
Quality for this price is amazing. Inside the box is a small blue flashlight & a piece of paper so you can use test them<br>Design looks perfect.<br>You can wear these glasses with any outfit.
Love these blue light glasses soo much!! I looked at a lot of different blue light glasses but ended up going with these because they looked smaller than a lot of other ones. I have a smaller face/head and these are the perfect size! Not too big or small. They have also helped me so much with head aches that I was getting from staring at my screen during this quarantine. Would definitely recommend and such a great price!
I noticed a difference right away when I started wearing these glasses. The reviews were great so I decided to try them and I am not disappointed. They help when driving at night with the bright lights. I use them when doing my computer work so I don’t strain my eyes. & They're super cute! Wish they were a bit sturdier but I love them and would definitely buy again!
These light blocking glasses were made in bad materials. One of the pair glass's flame was damage when I received.
The glasses come packaged nicely. They each have their own cloth covering in the box. Both are very comfortable and fit nicely. The glasses are cute and stylish. They do seem to help reduce the blue lights. I notice the screen isn’t as bright and doesn’t hurt my eyes/head after looking at the monitor all day (work requires me to use a computer). Give them a try.
The blue light blocking glasses I bought don't fit well[9527] they are a little big[9527] and they look bad quality[9527] I don't like them[9527] so I want to return them.
I was looking for eye glasses to block the blue lights from my laptop. I work for more than 8 hours on laptop and this is really good product for it. It blocks the harmful lights and reduces the strain on the eyes. Definitely feels lighter after using it with continuous work.
Me and my fiancé work at computers all day so I wanted to try these out. First day without having a headache after a long day!! So I would consider that a win.
I’m definitely getting less headaches by wearing these while working on my laptop.
One of the glasses arrived with a couple scratches down the lense I’m bummed I have to go in to ups to make a return :( during the covid. They looked like they would look nice on but scratched lenses are not going to work
We love these. I am a teacher and since starting distance learning I had massive headaches. Now wearing these glasses while on the computer I have gotten NO headaches!! My husband now wears them too and loves them.
I bought these for my daughter & myself!  Love they come in their own little bags.  I wear mine all day at work since my job is on the computer.  I can tell a huge difference and not as many headaches.  My daughter wears her pair around the house while on her phone or when she is using the computer.  They are pretty sylish as well.
Great glasses! They do what they say and they look great too. The fit is perfect.
I was a nit skeptical based on other reviews that they were kind of big but I decided to go for it anyway. I don't experience headaches but I do look at a computer screen for 8+ hours per day and understand the effects of blue light so thought I'd give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I don't wear glasses so wearing these people were shocked[9527] I get many compliments every day! Now I am hooked on wearing them at work and if I look at the screen for a minute without them on I immediately notice the difference and stop to put them on. Give them a try! And the price for 2 of them[9527] amazing!
I’m so happy I finally decided to get these. I love been squinting at work but have great eyesight. With age I thought I might need readers but after wearing these for the past week[9527] there’s definitely a difference. Not being used to glasses[9527] it took some getting used to but I won’t work without them now.
  Can’t tell whether it actually cuts blue light. A little too heavy[9527] kept slipping off my nose.
Thought they would be reading glasses[9527] but these had to be put over glasses and not large enough to do that.  No packing slip for return.
Was surprised to see such a nice presentation. The packaging[9527] the bag and the glasses themselves were all impressive. They do a good job as well.  Well worth the price. We are using them fo rboth  computer and phone reading.
Love the style! I like that I can wear these glasses and not even realize they are on!! They are light weight and very comfortable!
A friend recommended that I try these glasses after I complained of a headache while on the computer.  They made a world of difference.  No more headaches.<br><br>Thanks[9527]<br><br>Sharon
I bought these to help with eye strain.  AND BOY DO THEY WORK!!!  Driving in south Texas is a brilliant proposition[9527] but these have taken the place of my sun glasses most days.  In the summer[9527] with the sun right overhead[9527] these kill the blue[9527] and make the trip much better on my tired eyes.  Even around the house[9527] they work to keep the eyes from straining.  I really do like them.  I even like the "retired professor" vibe they throw out.  All I need is a pipe and some slippers.....
You get two in a nice lil  box. They are individually wrapped with the cleaner cloth included.<br><br>I got the black and cheetah pair. They do not leave an indention on your nose and dont slide off .<br><br>If you have a job in IT and dont need prescriptions[9527] there are  you buddy for life.
Product was as described. Glasses are good quality. I like that there is 2 included. Frames are comfortable. I can already tell a difference wearing them with less eye strain[9527] easier to relax and go to bed. I highly recommend!
Truly amazing blue light blocking glass. One for me and one for my brother. And great style package too with pouches to carry around.
I was not at all satisfied.
The quality of this Light Blocking Glasses is not good[9527] I feel very uncomfortable and don't like it
I work on a computer 10 hours a day and was getting horrible headaches so I figured I'd give these glasses a try. I'm so impressed with how quickly they helped. I've been using them for a few weeks now[9527] and have been able to work without any trouble now. They have a yellowish tint and you can see all the blue light they reflect off when you're wearing them. You receive two pairs too so it's a great deal[9527] would definitely recommend!
These glasses are perfect for me! As a college student[9527] I spend a ton of time on my computer and phone. Staring at a screen for hours really strains my eyes and caused headaches. These glasses have helped tremendously with that. They block glared and are also very stylish. I love the leopard print! I gave my sister the second pair and she is obsessed with them too!
Great quality product for a great price.
  Have completely eliminated all headaches that I would normally get on a daily basis. The quality of the glasses was beyond what I expected. Totally worth the purchase.
  Good product
We love them
These glasses do seem to help.  Attractive and came nicely boxed in fabric[9527]  pull string sleeves. My only problem with them is that I need to hold them in place over my 3.0 cheater magnifying glasses.  Wish they offered them in different magnifying ranges.  For me[9527] well worth the cost.
These are so cute and effective! I dont wear glasses normally so it did take me a day to get used to them.
  UPDATE:  I contacted the seller directly about our defective pair of glasses along the with picture above.  They sent us two pair just like we'd ordered for no charge[9527] and they were here within just a couple of days.  Great customer service as I see it.<br><br>Just received these today so I can't yet speak to their effectiveness.  My teenage daughter had requested to try some for using her computer all day for school.  When we took out the black pair[9527] the left lens was distorted like looking through an old window.  The right lens was fine. It's hard to see in the photo (barring the focus of the photo)[9527] but you can see how my blinds do not look straight in the circled area on the left side but are fine looking through the other.  The second tortoise shell pair was also fine[9527] but we were hoping for two usable pairs in different styles.
These glasses are made in stylish designs with cute lenses so you can really wear them anywhere! They have the durability of a standard pair of glasses[9527] so I don’t feel like they’re cheaply made or anything. I am on my phone a lot and dealing with screens a lot throughout my day so I appreciate these a lot to prevent against blue light related ailments. They came in a super cool box that pulls out to reveal your glasses[9527] each with their own smearproof carrying pouch. Thanks for a great product!
I'm constantly working on my computer and over the past couple of months[9527] I've noticed suttle changes in my vision.  My eyes were tired my vision was blurred[9527] and I would get headaches.  So[9527] I purchased these to see if they would help with issues.  I have noticed that there is more clarity[9527] no headaches from straining my eyes[9527]  and no glare.  The frames are ligh[9527] comfortable[9527] and most of all fashionable.
These are really good and help with the blue light.  They sit just far enough on my face to not hit my long eyelashes[9527] but they have a tint to them.  It's like wearing the slightest tinted sunglasses inside.
These are a gift and they seem sturdy and look nice too!

He wears them all the time now.  Even when he doesn't need to!  He wanted them to protect his eyes while gaming[9527] working on his computer and watching TV.  He said they have reduced his headaches.  They look super good on him and they must be super comfortable because he even wears them all the time[9527] even when driving.  What really impressed me about these was actually seeing how they protect your eyes.  I wouldn't have believed it if I wouldn't have seen it with my own eyes.
Such a great product[9527] I recommend them for anyone who encounters blue light for several hours a day.
I liked the look and quality of the glasses. They arrived on time and have worked perfectly! No negative feedback whatsoever.
  They are just as described.
These are the best blue light glasses I own! They are such great quality and you can tell they would be just from the packaging. They come with a blue light tester so you can really see how they protect your eyes. They are a little too wide for my face[9527] but I don’t care as long as they protect my eyes!
These work really well to prevent eye strain while looking at any sort of screen that gives off a blue light. They fit well and are comfortable[9527] they are sturdy and great quality. Great[9527] helpful product.
